<p><em>This is the history of a Lie&#8212;of a cruel and terrible
Lie invented for the purpose of defaming the entire Jewish
people. Given out as fiction, by a German anti-Semitic
writer, involved in the Waldeck forgery case, who
concealed his identity under the pen-name of an Englishman,
it was gradually changed and elaborated, and finally
groomed as fact. Agents of the Russian secret police
department and of the unscrupulous &#8220;Black Hundreds&#8221;
then utilized this fiction as the framework for the &#8220;protocols&#8221;
through which they sought to crush the Jews and
prop up the tottering Russian dynasty.</em></p>

<p><em>Tsarism destroyed itself, but the agents of Tsarism,
still dreaming of their past glory and of a restoration of
their privileges, are at work again, both here and abroad.</em></p>

<p><em>Out of the scrapheap of Russian autocracy, they have
exhumed their old weapons and are striking at the Jews
again. Upon the structure of the old myths they are
striving to erect new falsehoods in order to intensify
everywhere chaos and confusion and dissatisfaction so
that they may attain their own dastardly and selfish ends.</em></p>

<p><em>In the war&#8217;s aftermath the Jews are being blamed by
the minions of autocracy and reaction for all the ills that
have befallen mankind. Some blame them for the war,
and others for the peace. Some attack them for the
defeat of the German military machine, and others
for the victory of the allies. In Germany they are attacked
by the Junkers for having opposed the submarine
warfare and thus assured Germany&#8217;s defeat; while in
some of the allied countries the Jews are denounced for
constituting &#8220;the brains of Germany.&#8221; All the revolutionary
<a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a><span class="pagenum" title="4"></span>leaders of Germany are credited to the Jews, and
bolshevism, which has as little in common with Judaism
as it has with Christianity, is branded as a Jewish movement;
and there are Jew-baiters who in their blind
madness have gone so far as to declare that ex-Kaiser
Wilhelm was not only influenced by the Jews but is himself
of Jewish descent, and for this reason did not
defend Germany as loyally as he should have done. He
conspired against the Hohenzollern dynasty and undermined
it. He destroyed his own throne because he was
serving the secret Jewish world organization.</em></p>

<p><em>On such absurdities have people been fed, since the
armistice, in civilized countries by antisemitic agitators
and their dupes, while Jews have been slaughtered in the
Ukraine, in Poland and in Hungary.</em></p>

<p><em>I submit in this little book the documentary evidence
showing how the so-called &#8220;Protocols of the Wise Men
of Zion&#8221; on which this new crusade is predicated, were
forged.</em></p>

<h3>THE MYSTERIOUS PROTOCOLS</h3>

<h4>The Lie of a Jewish World Conspiracy&#8212;Is There a Jewish
Conspiracy?&#8212;Anonymous Accusations&#8212;The Mysterious &#8220;Protocols&#8221;
of Sergei Nilus&#8212;How did &#8220;Nilus&#8221; Secure Them?&#8212;Contradictory
Explanations&#8212;Who is &#8220;Nilus&#8221;?&#8212;How his
Sponsors Disagree&#8212;What Russian Publicists Say.</h4>


<p>Is there a Jewish conspiracy against the world or is
there a conspiracy against the Jews? What are the so-called
&#8220;Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion?&#8221; Who is
&#8220;the Russian mystic,&#8221; Sergius Nilus, the sponsor of the
Protocols? What forces are behind the anti-Jewish
propaganda that is international in scope and that seeks
at this time to spread all over the world the poison of
prejudice and hatred against the Jews, reviving long-exploded
mediaeval legends?</p>

<p>Many Americans have asked these questions ever since
the publication of &#8220;The Cause of the World Unrest,&#8221;
&#8220;The Protocols and World Revolution,&#8221; &#8220;The Protocols
of the Wise Men of Zion,&#8221; and the anti-Jewish articles in
Henry Ford&#8217;s Dearborn Independent.</p>

<p>In 1919 a translation of extracts from what purports
to be a book by one Sergius Nilus was published in Germany.
During 1920 a translation was published in England
under the name of &#8220;The Jewish Peril,&#8221; and under
various titles, in different versions, it was reproduced in
the United States, France, Sweden, Denmark, Finland
and even Japan. The Japanese edition is in the Russian
language. In all these books &#8220;the Russian mystic,&#8221;
Sergius Nilus, is given as the sponsor of a number of
secret &#8220;documents&#8221; by which it is intended to show that
<a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a><span class="pagenum" title="8"></span>the Jews are responsible for all the ills that have already
befallen the world and that are still to come.</p>

<p>The method is simple. Was there a revolution in Russia?
Blame the Jews. Was there a revolution in Germany?
Blame the Jews. Who made the French Revolution?
The Jews. Who caused the World War? The
Jews. Who profited by the war? The Jews. Is there
anywhere an industrial crisis? The Jews are, of course,
the cause of it. Has the World War brought forth Bolshevism?
The Jews are naturally the fathers of it. First
the Jews engineered the war, and then they pulled the
strings behind the scenes of the Peace Conference. They
secured special privileges at the Peace Table, because,
according to the Protocols, they control the gold of the
world, the press of the world, the rulers of the world.
And if, as a result of the World War, millions of Jews
have suffered untold agonies, persecution, starvation, and
pogroms, it is no doubt only part of their deep-laid plot
to gain control of the world for Zion through poverty
and suffering!</p>

<p>Are governments just to the Jews, giving them
equal rights? Then it is obvious that Jews are either at
the head of such governments or are hidden behind the
present rulers. If the Jews cannot exert sufficient influence
over the rulers themselves, there are Jewesses
in high places, through whom the cause of Zion is served&#8212;and
all this is done by the Jews with but one aim in
view&#8212;to dominate the world, to become its autocratic
masters, to break down the moral power of Christendom
and set up Israel as &#8220;the despot&#8221; over the peoples of the
earth. According to the Protocols, all this is engineered
with the aid and through the instrumentality of the Freemasons.</p>

<p>The propagandists everywhere, in Germany, England,
<a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a><span class="pagenum" title="9"></span>France, the Scandinavian countries, Japan and the United
States, basing all their arguments on the &#8220;Protocols&#8221;
vouched for by &#8220;the Russian mystic&#8221; Sergius Nilus, see
in the present chaotic conditions the absolute fulfillment
of the prophecies outlined by the so-called &#8220;Wise Men
of Zion&#8221; years ago. The propagandists are violent and
vicious, foaming at their mouths, appealing to the basest
passions, insinuating, accusing, pointing their fingers at
&#8220;the source of all evil&#8221;&#8212;at the Jews who constitute but
a fraction of one per cent of the world&#8217;s population, and
who are in Europe to-day, after the close of the World
War, more wretched and miserable than ever before,&#8212;persecuted,
hounded and starved.</p>

<p>What are these mysterious Protocols? How did they
come to &#8220;the Russian mystic&#8221; who revealed them in 1905,
and which have now been exhumed from obscurity for
the purpose of enlightening the world, and which point
to the Jews as the cause of all unrest, chaos and confusion?</p>

<p>Nilus, &#8220;the Russian mystic,&#8221; is credited with several
versions of how he had secured the Protocols, and his
stories flatly contradict one another. In 1905 he said
that the Protocols were given to him by a prominent Russian
conservative whose name he did not mention, and
who in turn had received them from an unnamed woman
who had stolen them from &#8220;one of the most influential
leaders of Freemasonry at the close of a secret meeting
of the initiated in France.&#8221; Then, several years later,
Nilus wrote that his friend himself had stolen the
Protocols from &#8220;the headquarters of the Society of Zion
in France.&#8221; Several years afterwards, in a new edition
of his book, Nilus said that the &#8220;Protocols&#8221; came from
Switzerland and not from France. This time he named
his Russian conservative friend, Sukhotin, who had died
<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a><span class="pagenum" title="10"></span>in the meantime. He added that the Protocols were not
Jewish-Masonic but Zionist documents secretly read at
the Zionist Congress in Basle in 1897.</p>

<p>Then followed a new edition of the Nilus book bearing
the date of 1917. A translation of this edition has recently
appeared in this country, containing a brand-new
explanation as to how the Protocols were rescued and
given to the world. This explanation is taken from the
German version published in Charlottenburg. The introduction
to that edition says that the Protocols, having
been read from day to day at the Basle Congress, were
sent as read to Frankfort on the Main. The disclosure
of them came through the infidelity of the messenger.</p>

<p>The 1917 edition is published with a prologue and an
epilogue, like a drama, which indeed it is, with all the
ingredients of melodrama&#8212;a villain, a mysterious woman,
a Grand Duke, a conspiracy to destroy the world, and a
saint&#8212;Nilus, who convicts himself in his own writings
of falsification in the giving of these various accounts of
how the Protocols came into his possession.</p>

<p>Nothing is known of Sergius Nilus. Russian standard
reference books and encyclopedias contain no mention of
his name.</p>

<p>The anonymous American editor of the Nilus book
gives the following information about Nilus:</p>

<p>&#8220;Serge Nilus, in the 1905 edition of whose book was
first published the <em>Zionist Protocols</em>, was, as he states,
born in the year 1862, of Russian parents holding liberal
opinions. His family was fairly well known in Moscow,
for its members were educated people who were firm in
their allegiance to the Tsar and the Greek Church. On
one side he is said to have been connected by marriage
with the nobility of the Baltic provinces. Nilus himself
was graduated from the University of Moscow and early
<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a><span class="pagenum" title="11"></span>entered the civil service, obtaining a small appointment
in the law courts. Later, he received a post under the
Procurator of a provincial court in the Caucasus. Finally,
tiring of the law, he went to the Government of Orel,
where he was a landowner and a noble. His spiritual life
had been tumultuous and full of trouble, and finally he
entered the Troitsky-Sergevsky Monastery near Moscow.
&#8216;In answer to his appeal for pardon, Saint Sergei, stern
and angry, appeared to him twice in a vision. He left
the Monastery a converted man.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;From 1905 until the present, little is known of his
activities. Articles are said to have appeared from time
to time in the Russian press from his pen. A returning
traveller from Siberia in August, 1919, was positive in his
statement that Nilus was in Irkutsk in June of that
year. Whether his final fate was that of Admiral Kolchak
is not known.&#8221;</p>

<p>The American editor of Sergius Nilus&#8217;s book containing
the &#8220;Protocols&#8221; is hiding behind anonymity. The name
of the traveller from Siberia who was so positive in his
statement that Nilus was in Irkutsk is also concealed.
And Serge Nilus to whom Saint Sergei &#8220;appeared twice
in a vision&#8221; &#8220;is said to have written articles in the Russian
press&#8221; of which nobody has knowledge.</p>

<p>In Germany, Nilus is described as follows:</p>
<p>&#8220;Sergius Nilus was an employee of the Russian secret
police department, of the <em>okhrana</em>, connected with the
Church, especially relating to &#8216;foreign religions.&#8217; He lived
for some time at the Optina Pustina monastery. In 1901
he published a book entitled &#8216;The Great in the Small and
the Anti-Christ.&#8217; According to the Lutsch Sveta, Nilus
claims to have received in 1901 a copy of the text of the
Protocols from the secret archives of the Main Zionist
organization in France, but he published the &#8216;protocols&#8217;
<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a><span class="pagenum" title="12"></span>only in 1905. A second edition appeared in 1911, and
finally another edition was brought out in the beginning
of 1917, but all copies are said to have been destroyed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Cause of the World Unrest,&#8221; an anonymous book
published in England and reprinted in this country, speaks
of Nilus and the &#8220;Protocols&#8221; as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;In the year 1903 a Russian, Serge Nilus, published a
book entitled <em>The Great in Little</em>. The second edition,
which was published at Tsarskoye Selo in 1905, had an
additional chapter, the twelfth, under the heading &#8216;Anti-Christ
as a Near Political Possibility.&#8217; This chapter consisted
of some twenty pages of introduction followed by
the text of twenty-four &#8216;Protocols of Meetings of the
Learned Elders of Zion,&#8217; and the book ends with some
twenty pages of commentaries on these protocols by Nilus.</p>

<p>&#8220;Directly after the protocols, comes a statement by
Nilus that they are &#8216;signed by representatives of Zion
of the thirty-third degree.&#8217; These protocols were secretly
extracted or were stolen from a whole volume of protocols.
All this was got by my correspondent out of the
secret depositories of the Head Chancellery of Zion. This
Chancellery is at present on French territory.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the edition of 1917 Sergius Nilus wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;My book has already reached the fourth edition, but it is
only definitely known to me now and in a manner worthy of
belief, and that through Jewish sources, that these protocols
are nothing other than the strategic plans for the conquest of
the world under the heel of Israel, and worked out by the
leaders of the Jewish people&#8212;and read by the &#8216;Prince of Exile,&#8217;
Theodor Herzl, during the first Zionist Congress, summoned by
him in August, 1897, in Basle.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>It will be shown later that the so-called Butmi edition
of the &#8220;protocols&#8221; published in 1907 contains the definite
statement of the man who claims to have translated them
<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a><span class="pagenum" title="13"></span>into Russian from the French in 1901 that the Elders of
Zion mentioned in the Protocols are not to be confounded
with the Zionist movement.</p>

<p>In the 1917 edition Sergius Nilus wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;In 1901 I came into possession of a manuscript, and this
comparatively small book was destined to cause a deep change
in my entire viewpoint as can only be caused in the heart of
man by Divine Power. It was comparable with the miracle of
making the blind see. &#8216;May Divine acts show on him.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;This manuscript was called &#8216;the protocols of the Zionist
Men of Wisdom,&#8217; and it was given to me by the now deceased
leader of the Tchernigov nobility, who later became vice-governor
of Stavropol, Alexis Nikolayevitch Sukhotin. I had already
begun to work with my pen for the glory of the Lord, and I
was friendly with Sukhotin. <em>He was a man of my opinion</em>,
that is, extremely conservative, as they are now termed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sukhotin told me that he in turn had obtained the manuscript
from a lady who always lived abroad. This lady was a
noblewoman from Tchernigov. He mentioned her by name, but
I have forgotten it. He said that she obtained it in some mysterious
way, by theft, I believe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sukhotin also said that one copy of the manuscript was
given by this lady to Sipiagin, the Minister of the Interior,
upon her return from abroad, and that Sipiagin was subsequently
killed. He said other things of the same mysterious character.
But when I first became acquainted with the contents of the
manuscript I was convinced that its terrible, cruel and straight-forward
truth is witness of its true origin from the &#8216;Zionist Men
of Wisdom,&#8217; and that no other evidence of its origin would be
needed.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Feodor Roditchev, one of Russia&#8217;s most famous liberals,
a member of the nobility, a former member of the
Duma, writing recently of the Nilus protocols and of
Sukhotin whom Nilus described as a man of his own
opinion, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;For months I hear on all sides about the Nilus book and its
success in England, and I am asked, Who is Nilus? There was
a Nilus, an associate justice of the Moscow District Court. It
<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a><span class="pagenum" title="14"></span>is said that the manuscript was given to Nilus by Sukhotin,
the notorious zemstvo official of Chernsk.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Berlin edition contains no mention of Sukhotin, but in
that edition Nilus said, &#8216;Pray for the soul of the boyar Alexis.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The name of the notorious Alexey <a name="typo11" id="typo11"></a>Nikolayevitch Sukhotin
means nothing to the present generation. But there was a time
when his name attracted attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sukhotin arrested the peasants of a whole village for refusing
to cart manure from his stables because the animals
there were infected with glanders. Judge Tsurikov released the
peasants. Tsurikov was removed for this, while Sukhotin justified
his act by writing to the Minister of the Interior, Durnovo,
that he had arrested the peasants not because they refused to
cart his manure but because they dared disobey him as a zemstvo
official. The reactionary <a name="typo1_a"></a>Chernsk nobility made Sukhotin marshal
of nobility. So it was this man who furnished the protocols
of the secret meetings of the representatives of Zion! But
how did Sukhotin get the protocols? An unknown friend had
brought them to him. They were given to him by an unknown
lady who had received them from an unknown but energetic
participant in the Basle Congress. Is this credible? Well,
then, there is another version of the origin of the protocols&#8212;but
that is for the German readers. The Russian government
sent a spy to the Basle Congress. He did not go to the Congress
himself, but bribed one of the participants. He was
carrying the protocols from Basle to Frankfurt to the local
masonic organization. He stopped on the way in a little town,
and gave the protocols to the spy. He engaged copyists who
worked all night and copied the protocols.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the first Russian version the protocols were supposed to
have been brought to Russia in French. According to the German
version, the protocols were copied, consequently they were
in German, but the most important thing is that the protocols
are not protocols at all, but a monograph&#8212;which could be called
&#8216;the dream of a member of the Black Hundreds.&#8217;&#8221;</p></div>

<p>A distinguished Russian publicist says of the sponsor
of the &#8220;protocols&#8221; as follows:</p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;In Russia the problems of Christianity and Judaism have
been studied by such men as Vladimir Solovyov, Professor
Troitzky, Professor Kokovtsev, Kartashov, Bulgakov, Berdyayev&#8212;men
<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a><span class="pagenum" title="15"></span>of profound intellect and a living conscience. In them
the counterfeit ravings of the ignorant monk (Nilus) evoked
but a smile of contempt. The low level of the circles in which
men like Nilus moved and worked is only too well known. It
was the world of police denunciations, divorce perjuries, monastic
servility and feigned, blasphemous piety. In order to
attract attention, Nilus&#8217;s &#8216;Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion&#8217;
had to emigrate from Russia. And the further away they went,
the better they fared.&#8221;</p></div>

<h3>THE STORY FROM WHICH THE PROTOCOLS WERE FABRICATED</h3>

<h4>Essence of &#8220;Protocols&#8221; Was German Fiction of &#8220;Sir John Retcliffe&#8221;&#8212;Who
Was &#8220;Retcliffe&#8221;?&#8212;His Infamous Record&#8212;His
Bloodcurdling Story&#8212;The Meeting in the Cemetery&#8212;An
Avowed Myth&#8212;Meeting Every Hundred Years Attended by
&#8220;Representatives of the Twelve Tribes of Israel&#8221;&#8212;The &#8220;Son
of the Accursed&#8221; Also Attends and Provides Comic Interludes.</h4>


<p>The query now naturally arises, what is the origin of
these much heralded &#8220;Protocols&#8221; which were published
in Russia by Sergius Nilus in 1905, and a copy of which,
it is triumphantly announced, is now in the British
Museum?</p>

<p>The anti-Jewish propagandists everywhere content
themselves with the &#8220;history&#8221; of the origin of the &#8220;Protocols&#8221;
as given by the &#8220;Russian mystic&#8221; Sergius Nilus.
But fortunately &#8220;murder will out,&#8221; and the criminals who
perpetrated the stupendous forgery for the purpose of
slandering the Jews have left behind clues that enable
one to visualize the very process that they pursued in
the perpetration of their crime.</p>

<p>In 1866-1870 there appeared in Berlin a series of novels
entitled &#8220;Biarritz&#8212;Rome&#8221; purporting to have been written
by &#8220;Sir John Retcliffe,&#8221; the pseudonym of Herman
Goedsche, a German novelist with an unsavory past. To
conceal his identity and to convey the impression that
the antisemitism with which his writings abounded
emanated from English sources, he selected &#8220;Sir John
Retcliffe&#8221; as his pen-name.</p>

<p>According to <em>Meyer&#8217;s Konversations Lexikon</em> (Sixth
<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a><span class="pagenum" title="17"></span>edition, 1904, Volume VIII, page 77), Herman Goedsche
was born in February, 1815, in Trachenberg, Silesia, and
died on November 8, 1878, at Warmbrunn. He was employed
in the postal service, but as he was implicated in
the Waldeck forgery case, he left the service in 1849, and
devoted himself to literary work. Under the name of
&#8220;Armin&#8221; he published a number of works of fiction, but
he was best known under the name of &#8220;Sir John Retcliffe,&#8221;
having published a series of sensational novels
describing the Crimean war, &#8220;Sebastopol,&#8221; &#8220;Rena-Sahib,&#8221;
&#8220;Villafranca,&#8221; &#8220;Puebla,&#8221; &#8220;Biarritz,&#8221; in 1866. A new edition
of these works appeared in Berlin in 1903-4.</p>

<p><em>Brockhaus&#8217; Konversations Lexikon</em> (supplement volume
XVII, 1904) refers to Goedsche, the novelist, known
under the name of &#8220;Sir John Retcliffe&#8221; (formerly
&#8220;Armin&#8221;), as having played an infamous role in the
Waldeck forgery case. He was compelled to leave the
postal service, and later became a member of the staff of
the <em>Preussische Kreutz Zeitung</em>.</p>

<p>The chapter of the Goedsche-Retcliffe novel which on
even a cursory reading will be found to contain the very
essence of the Nilus Protocols was published as a separate
booklet in a Russian translation in 1872, avowedly
as a work of fiction. I have found a copy of this little
volume in the Russian Department of the Library of
Congress, Washington, D.&nbsp;C.</p>

<p>An examination of this chapter, entitled &#8220;The Jewish
Cemetery in Prague and the Council of Representatives
of the Twelve Tribes of Israel,&#8221; will disclose the fact
that every substantive statement contained in the Protocols
and elaborated in them is to be found in the Goedsche-Retcliffe
novelette.</p>

<p>We are thus supplied with an early draft of the so-called
Protocols, which have now been given worldwide
<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a><span class="pagenum" title="18"></span>publicity by anti-Jewish propagandists, and which were
first introduced to the world in the form of a clumsy
piece of blood-curdling fiction of the dime-novel variety.</p>

<p>In substantiation of this statement I now present a
translation of this chapter of the Russian version of this
novel found in the Library of Congress in Washington,
published in St. Petersburg nearly fifty years ago.</p>

<h3>FOREWORD</h3>


<p>&#8220;The description of the Jewish cemetery in Prague and
the legendary story of the meeting of the representatives
of the twelve tribes of Israel are borrowed from the
historico-political novel by Sir John Radcliff, &#8216;To Sedan,&#8217;
published in the magazine edited by Nicholas Stepanovitch
Lvoff.</p>

<p>&#8220;The contents of the legend are not the invention of
Radcliff himself; rather Radcliff, with his characteristic
fantastic imagination, collected various parts into one
whole and painted all with poetic colors, which strike one
perhaps by their excessive gaudiness, but which are nevertheless
interesting.&#8221;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Passed by the Censor, St. Petersburg, May 17, 1872</p>

<p>This product of &#8220;Radcliff&#8217;s fantastic imagination,&#8221; the
work of one experienced in the perpetration of forgeries,
will now be permitted to tell its own story. It requires
no commentary. It clearly foreshadows the protocols,
with all its accompaniment of melodrama, not even omitting
the Devil, himself.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>THE JEWISH CEMETERY IN PRAGUE</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>The Council of Representatives of the Twelve Tribes of Israel</p>


<p>&#8220;The Jewish quarter of Prague represents a remarkable
labyrinth of crooked and narrow streets; it is situated in the
outskirts of Prague which witnessed numerous bloody episodes
of Bohemian and German history. The dwellers of the dirty
and dilapidated houses of this quarter are engaged in petty
<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a><span class="pagenum" title="23"></span>trading and profiteering in their own as well as in other parts
of the city. Prague is the only city in Germany where the
Jews live entirely isolated from the nation whose name they
have taken in order to avail themselves of the privileges of the
city population and to exploit it for their own purposes. The
Jewish quarter in Prague is the same as the rag-fair in Vienna
and the Temple in Paris. In these places deals amounting to
thousands are transacted daily.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you take a few steps along this dirty, foul market-place,
you will suddenly come upon an old, high, decayed wall which
surrounds a space of from two to three acres. Elder-trees and
other wild shrubbery wind around this wall. Old Jewish houses
are crowded all along near this wall, threatened with destruction
at any moment. The strange circle formed by this wall
has an unwelcome, puzzling appearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the city of the dead&#8212;the renowned Prague cemetery.</p>

<p>&#8220;In this abode of rest may be seen the spirit of the nation,
whose bones found shelter here after long wandering,&#8212;here is
stamped all its history, full of sufferings, struggles and resistance.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems as though at any moment these tombs, overgrown
with shrubbery, are ready to open, these stones growing for
thousands of years are ready to raise themselves, and to let out
into the world the restless wanderer with a pack upon his
shoulder, with a staff in his hand, in order to go again to
strange peoples,&#8212;to cheat and combat them and to seek a new
Canaan&#8212;his dominion! The Jewish cemetery in Prague is the
very oldest cemetery known. It was closed by order of the
government a hundred years ago. For foreigners it is a
historical landmark; for the Jews it is a sacred place. The
impression of this deserted spot is intensified by its surroundings.
Amidst the closely crowded tombs and monuments, overgrown
with moss, only a narrow passage remains which is almost
entirely covered with shrubbery of thorn-bushes and mat-weed.</p>

<p>&#8220;During the inspection, the watchman will tell the visitor the
history of the death of Rabbi Ben Manasseh, the great conqueror
of death, and Rabbi Loewe, the most learned Rabbi of the 17th
century; he will speak of Simon the Just and of the Polish
princess Anna Shmiless. He will then lead the visitor to the
monument of Anna Kohn on which can be read the mysterious
figure 606, which shows that the Jews, more than twelve hundred
<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a><span class="pagenum" title="24"></span>years ago, had buried their dead here, in the legendary times of
Lyubush and her daughters.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we are not to believe this figure, we must nevertheless
agree with the opinion of the Jews that this is the oldest settlement
and the first Jewish community in Europe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silently the Jewish guide and the curious foreigner go by
one place where under an old lilac bush a heap of stone stands
out, and when the foreigner asks, &#8216;What is this?&#8217; the guide
gives an evasive answer&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Beth Chaim&#8212;the house of life.&#8217; Thus is the cemetery
called. Yes, indeed, this place of rest is a house of life, for
from here is given the mysterious impulse which makes the
exiles masters of the earth and tyrants of nations,&#8212;the impulse
which directs the golden calf to the chosen tribe.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Jewish town has assumed a holiday aspect. The stands
of the petty retailers have disappeared; Jewish boys and girls
were strolling about in their holiday attire. The houses and
windows were adorned with green branches. On the old benches
sat men, talking seriously; in the alleys youths were chatting.
From time to time men and women in their best Sabbath clothes
were going to the synagogue, carrying prayer books in their
hands; while poor Christian women whom need had forced
to work in this quarter were running with keys and dishes in
order to prepare for the feast.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the last day of the Feast of Booths, the day of
Assembly, and dusk was gathering over the narrow streets,
while the Christian part of the city was still brightly illumined
by the last rays of the setting sun. Two men (the older wore
a black silk mantle, with long earlocks, which showed that he
was a Polish Jew; the other was middle aged, in modern clothes,
with diamond studs in his shirt and a heavy golden chain on
his vest) walked along the narrow streets, without paying any
attention to the crowd.</p>

<p>&#8220;The younger seemed to be the guide. Having come with his
companion to the little house where the watchman of the cemetery
lived, he knocked at the closed door, through a crevice of
which the bright light of wax candles was seen, showing the
watchman&#8217;s holiday mood. It was a good summer&#8212;a large
number of foreigners had visited the cemetery and were generous
in their gifts.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the doorway appeared the thin face of the watchman,
<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a><span class="pagenum" title="25"></span>whose short-sighted eyes began to look fixedly into the darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Come out into the street, Joel, somebody wants to talk to
you!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;O, God of Justice,&#8217; said the watchman with amazement, as
he came out of the door,&#8212;&#8216;One of the trustees! What is your
pleasure to command me?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;This Rabbi desires to make a brief prayer in the cemetery;
he is leaving to-morrow morning by train.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;In the cemetery? This evening? But you know yourself,
Mr. Banker, that I am forbidden to open the gates after sunset,
and to-night is also the holy Sabbath.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;First of all, there is no need for you to shout here about my
calling,&#8217; replied the banker, displeased. &#8216;Every Jewish rag-picker
will know that banker Rosenberg was here to see you. As for
the permit to open the gates, I myself, as a trustee, authorize
you to do it. I will wait here until he has completed his prayer.
The company in your house must not know what we are doing
here. Arrange it so that the curious crowd will not rush in
there.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The watchman disappeared in the house, but soon returned
with a bunch of keys and opened the gates of the cemetery.
He took a lantern along and was about to light it.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Don&#8217;t!&#8217; said the Rabbi in a low voice. &#8216;I don&#8217;t need any
light. Lock the gates from the inside!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;But, Mr. von Rosenberg&#8212;&#8212;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Lock it, I say!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The watchman obeyed.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Now lead me to the grave of the holy Rabbi Simeon-ben-Yehudah!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Hold on to my coat, esteemed sir,&#8217; said the watchman. &#8216;It
is dark and you may stumble over the old graves.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I can see better at night than in the daytime, my son!&#8217;
<a name="typo1" id="typo1"></a>answered the learned Polish Jew.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Here is the grave!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The old Rabbi reverently leaned over the tombstone. The
watchman heard him pronounce a prayer in Jewish. He used
so many words of ancient Hebrew, or some other words of a
language he did not understand, that he knew only a few separate
expressions, although he himself had been in the past a
teacher at the Bohemian community.</p>

<p>&#8220;Having completed his prayer, the stranger turned to the
watchman of the cemetery:</p>

<p><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a><span class="pagenum" title="26"></span>&#8220;&#8216;When you accepted the position from your predecessor, did
he not give you certain instructions?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Me?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes, you! It was so from the day the first person was buried
in this place.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, and what if he did give such instructions,&#8212;how
does that concern you? This the first time I am asked about
this matter since I am employed here.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Because this happens once in a hundred years, and human
life rarely lasts as long as that.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I see that you know about it, Rabbi,&#8217; said the frightened
watchman. &#8216;But I can obey you only if you mention the word
which was given to me by my predecessor, because I took a
sacred oath on the Bible.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Polish Jew bent down and slowly pronounced a word of
seven syllables.</p>

<p>&#8220;The watchman bowed respectfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You are the Rabbi!&#8217; he said. &#8216;All will be done as you command!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You will send away the friends who are feasting in your
house before the clock strikes eleven. At the first stroke you
will open the gates of the cemetery, and at the last stroke you
will get into your house, lock the doors and windows, lie down
in your bed and turn into a corpse together with the members
of your household,&#8212;into a corpse that sees and hears nothing.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I will neither look nor listen.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The angel of death will leave your soul in your body and
will force you to wander about among the graves to the end
of time if you do not carry out my orders correctly. Now go,
and remember that by virtue of your position you are the
servant of the great Jerusalem synagogue. I need not tell you
that you should not say anything to that vain, worldly man who
brought me here.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Both returned to the gates, near which the banker was still
on guard.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well,&#8217; he said, &#8216;your desire is fulfilled, Rabbi, and you may
inform my friend in Warsaw that Rosenberg and Son are
always ready to do a favor to a guest recommended by such a
personage. Now let us go home; my wife is waiting for us.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Let us go, my son,&#8217; replied the Rabbi. &#8216;But relieve me of
worldly pleasures. I shall spend the night in prayer!&#8217;</p>

<p><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a><span class="pagenum" title="27"></span>&#8220;The banker shrugged his shoulders and gave the watchman
a gold coin.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Joel,&#8217; he said in a low voice, &#8216;the other trustees of the community
must not know about this violation of the rule.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The watchman nodded, and the companion again disappeared
in the dark streets, which had already become deserted, while
in the houses people talked merrily and the sounds of holiday
festivities were heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;How poor, dirty and dark these little houses looked from
outside! But it was quite different within! In the rear rooms
of many of these houses the bright light of numerous wax candles
was reflected in the splendid high mirrors, in expensive dishes
and precious rugs. Girls and women, who in the morning perhaps
walked with trays in their hands, now were seated at the
tables in heavy silk gowns with golden chains and bracelets;
their jewels and diamonds were glittering.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>&#8220;The clock in the town-hall tower struck ten. In the chapel,
near the statue of St. Nepomucenus, upon a stone bench, sat a
large-sized man, with the pale serious face of Germanic type.
Every physiognomist, looking at him, would have said that this
man had devoted his youth to serious scientific work and that he
had spent many sleepless nights over books.</p>

<p>&#8220;The clock had just struck ten when upon the bridge appeared
a man in a light summer coat, of about the same age as the
young scientist. His face was pale, of waxen color, without the
slightest natural red in his cheeks; his particularly prominent
nose indicated his Jewish extraction; his forehead was high and
large, his head was strongly developed. He walked straight
over to the man who was waiting and who quickly arose.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Good evening. I see you have received my letter. Have
you it with you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes, I know it by heart, I have read it so many times. &#8220;My
friend,&#8221; it is written there, &#8220;I have promised to give you the
key to the Caballah, if I ever find the opportunity to do so.
Although I am not always in the habit of fulfilling my vows, I
am ready to fulfil this one, if you will wait for me in the
evening of October 8, in Prague, on the old Moldau bridge,
under the statue of Nepomucenus.&#8221; Then follows your name.&#8217;</p>

<p><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a><span class="pagenum" title="28"></span>&#8220;&#8216;Yes, that is correct. Have you not yet given up your desire?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Less than ever before! You would render science an invaluable
service.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Listen, doctor, bend down a little over the rail; that of
which we speak must not be heard even by the waves of the
Moldau, if we wish to remain alive.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The young scientist looked in astonishment at his comrade,
but did as he desired.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Three years ago, in Rome, when I promised to acquaint
you with the mysteries of the Caballah, I did it more for the
sake of boasting of a power and authority which, in reality, I
did not possess. Although I had studied for some time the
traditions of my nation, rather out of curiosity than because of
the love of knowledge, I knew very well that I could hardly
penetrate the corridor of those mysteries which I am still regarding
as the sophistry and roguishness of exalted minds, invented
for the purpose of holding fools in fear and subordination.
But several accidental discoveries, made by me since
then, have changed my views and have aroused in me a sense
of curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You know, notwithstanding our brief acquaintance, that I
am not the type of man who would abandon a clue or a conceived
plan. What has caused me to make you my companion
in satisfying my curiosity&#8212;that does not concern you. It is
enough that now we have an opportunity to satisfy our mutual
desire, and all depends on whether you will agree to accept
the conditions upon which I can make you a partner in my
investigation.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;If these are not against honor and conscience.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;In this respect you have nothing to risk, you are rather
risking something else&#8212;your life. Do you feel that you are
capable of facing a serious danger?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;For the sake of science, yes!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Very well, in that case I must tell you that I will lead you
to a place which we will not leave alive, if our presence is
discovered. The slightest suspicion that we were uninvited
witnesses of the secret will bring upon us persecution which will
kill us sooner or later.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You are whetting my curiosity, signor!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;That is all I wanted to tell you. The other thing&#8212;you
<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a><span class="pagenum" title="29"></span>know that I am a Jew by birth. Although the Jews have driven
me from their midst and cursed me according to their custom
and traditions because I adopted Christianity,&#8212;still I have my
own reasons for stipulating a condition&#8212;your word of honor
that you will be silent about all you will see and hear, until I
authorize you to speak.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I swear by my honor.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Very well. You will recall in your investigations of the
Caballah that in the mysterious books mention is made of a
meeting of the heads or chosen ones of the nation,&#8212;a meeting
which takes place from time to time?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes, in the Yezire it is said very definitely, and if I understood
correctly, such meetings take place every hundred years.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes. The last meeting took place in 1760 and you recall
that shortly afterward the movement of Judaism started. It is
now 1787 years since the destruction of Jerusalem and this year is
designated for a meeting of the Cabalistic Sanhedrin. This is
the day of the meeting; the place is this city. I want to be
present at this meeting in spite of the danger and am ready to
take you along with me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;But will it not be dishonest to listen, will it not be an unlawful
interference with other people&#8217;s secrets?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Per Bacco! as we Italians say; with such hesitations you
must abandon once for all the idea of fulfilling your desire. Or
do you think that the people who guard the secret of the
Caballah will bring it to you on a tray? As far as I am concerned,
I shall discover the secret, at any cost!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;After reflecting a few minutes, the scientist came to a decision.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I shall go with you, come what may!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Very well. Now we have agreed. Let us go,&#8212;there is no
time to lose.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>&#8220;The tower clock of the town-hall struck eleven. At the first
stroke a key clicked in the lock of the cemetery gates. Then
followed profound silence which indicated that the cemetery
was open. The lights in the Jewish houses were gradually
dying out, and at the same time the sounds of the merry feasting
also subsided.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mysterious silence reigned in that terrible place.</p>

<p><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a><span class="pagenum" title="30"></span>&#8220;The gates creaked softly; the rustling of long coats was
heard, touching the stones and shrubbery; finally a vague white
figure appeared and slipped by like a shadow along the pathways.</p>

<p>&#8220;This figure knelt before one of the tombstones; three times
it touched the stone with its forehead and softly whispered a
prayer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Along the path leading from the gates came an old man,
bent, limping, sighing and coughing. He came over to the
ancient tombstone, and lowered himself on his knees near the
white figure that had entered before him, and he, too, whispered
a prayer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then heavy footsteps were heard, and a tall, impressive figure
appeared on the road, clad in a white mantle, and he, too,
fell down on his knees, as though unwillingly, in front of the
tombstone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thirteen times this was repeated. Thirteen old men came
over to the tombstone. The doctor counted them, but he could
not understand whether they were alive or dead. A shiver
crept down his back, his heart began to beat faster from fright.
He involuntarily recalled the terrible legend of the Day of
Atonement in the tenth month, Tishri, in the synagogue of
Posen when, during the prayer of Kol Nidrei, the congregation
kept growing larger and larger; unknown people, pushing one
another, wrapped in prayer shawls, came in, one hundred after
another, until the terrified Rabbi lifted his hand as if
to curse and exclaimed: &#8216;He who has flesh in his cheeks,
let him throw off the prayer shawl!&#8217; Hundreds remained covered,
and when the prayer shawls were torn away from them,
all saw the skulls of the dead who had come out of the graves
to celebrate the Day of Atonement with the rest of the congregation.</p>

<p>&#8220;As there, it seemed to him that the prayer shawls had fallen
off the heads of the praying old men, and a row of dead skulls
appeared. At that moment the clock struck twelve. A sharp
metallic sound rang out on the grave, after which a blue flame
appeared and illumined the thirteen kneeling figures.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I greet you, Roshe beth Aboth (heads) of the twelve tribes
of Israel,&#8217; announced a dull voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;We greet you, son of the accursed.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;A hundred years have already passed. Where have the
Nesiyim (princes of the tribes) come from?&#8217;</p>

<p><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a><span class="pagenum" title="31"></span>&#8220;&#8216;From the lands where the nation of Adonai has been scattered
by the orders of our forefathers.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Are you ready to fulfil the promise during the coming century?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;We are ready!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Then say, whose representatives are you, and where do you
come from? Tribe of Judah?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;From Amsterdam,&#8217; replied a strong, loud voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Tribe of Benjamin?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Toledo!&#8217; came the dull answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Tribe of Levi?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Worms!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Tribe of Manasseh?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Budapest!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Tribe of Gad?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Cracow!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Tribe of Simeon?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Rome!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Tribe of Zebulun?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Paris!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Tribe of Dan?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;<a name="typo2" id="typo2"></a>Constantinople!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Tribe of Asher?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;London!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Tribe of Issachar?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The answer came in a faint voice and could not be heard distinctly.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Tribe of Naphtali?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Prague!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;And I am the representative of the unfortunate and exiles,&#8217;
said the man who asked the questions in a dull voice. &#8216;I am myself
wandering about all over the world in order that I may unite
you for the sake of the cause of redemption which has been
promised to the seed of Abraham and which was taken from
them by the sons of him who was crucified! Who is here of
the house of Aaron, let him rise, scrutinize the heads of the
tribes and gather the council.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man who was the first to arrive rose and then seated
himself upon the tombstone. One by one the others came over
to him and whispered in his ear a seven-syllabled word, and
each time he nodded in approval. After that all returned to
<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a><span class="pagenum" title="32"></span>their former places. &#8216;Brethren,&#8217; said the Levite, &#8216;our fathers
formed a union which compels all those chosen as representatives
of the tribes to gather every hundred years at the grave of the
great teacher of Caballah whose doctrines give the chosen ones
power on earth and supremacy over all the descendants of
Ishmael. Eighteen hundred years the struggle has been conducted
by the nation of Israel for supremacy which was promised
to Abraham and which was taken away from us by the
Cross. Trampled under foot by our enemies, under the terror
of death and all kinds of humiliation and violence, the nation
of Israel, nevertheless, has not abandoned this struggle, and as
they are scattered all over the earth, the whole earth must belong
to them! Our learned men are conducting this struggle for
hundreds of years; the nation is gradually rising from its fall;
its power is growing and spreading. To us belongs the earthly
god, which was made for us with such sorrow by Aaron in the
desert ... the Golden Calf which the backsliders are worshipping!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;We hear!&#8217; they whispered on all sides.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;When all the gold on earth will be ours, the power will go
over to us. Then will be fulfilled the promise made to Abraham.
Gold is the ruler of the earth. Gold is power, reward, pleasure
... all that human beings fear and desire. This is the mystery
of the Caballa ... the teachings concerning the spirit
which rules the world, and about the future! Eighteen centuries
we have belonged to our enemies. The future belongs to us. For
the fifth time in the course of the thousand-year-old struggle to
which we have consecrated ourselves, those who know of the existence
of the secret union have gathered here to take counsel
as to the means which are afforded us by the sins of our
enemies, and each time, for five hundreds years, a new Sanhedrim,
ordered the fiercest struggle. But, excepting Russia, not a
single century has been crowned with such success as this one.
Therefore we may think that the time for which we are striving
is near, and we may say, &#8220;The Future is ours!&#8221;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes, if persecutions against the Jews will not take place in
the meantime!&#8217; pointed out one of the men with a bitter smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The dark days of such a danger are passed. The success
of so-called civilization among the Christian nations may serve
as the best protection for our endeavors. Before listening to the
<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a><span class="pagenum" title="33"></span>individual opinions, let us examine the material means, the pure
capital possessed by the nation of Israel....&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;But against the three and a half million Jews with their
money there are 265 million enemies in Europe, or rather 500
million fists,&#8217; remarked one of these present.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The head will protect us against the fists, as in the past.
Labor is the slave of speculation, and violence is the slave of
wisdom. Who will deny that cunning is the distinctive trait
of our nation?</p>

<p>&#8220;<a name="typo3" id="typo3"></a>&#8216;Our nation is ostentatious and greedy, arrogant and pleasure-loving.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Where there is light there is also shadow. It is not in vain
that Adonai our God gave his chosen people the tenacity of a
snake, the cunning of a fox, the look of a falcon, the memory
of a dog, the diligence of an ant, and the sociability of a beaver.
We were in captivity on the rivers of Babylon, and have become
powerful! Our temple was destroyed, but we have built a
thousand new temples! For eighteen hundreds years we were
slaves; now we have grown head and shoulders above all other
nations.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;All the twelve pronounced the concluding words&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Brethren,&#8217; said the Levite, &#8216;the time has come when, in accordance
with the laws of the founder of our union, we must
determine ways and means by which the Jews shall attain their
goal as soon as possible; our experience of a hundred years will
help us in this. We who know must direct and guide the masses
which are blind. We, the builders, will combine the dead stones
into a pillar which must reach the sky.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The Tower of Babel was destroyed by the hand of Him
whose name I dare not pronounce,&#8217; said the sceptic.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Our structure rests upon the foundation of the promise
made to Abraham. It is your turn to speak, representative of
the tribe of Reuben! By what means will the Jewish nation
achieve power and supremacy over all other nations on earth?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;A shrill, unpleasant voice then spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;All the princes and the lands of Europe are at present in
debt. The stock exchange regulates these debts. But such things
are done only by movable capital; therefore all the movable
capital must go over to the hands of the Jews. The foundation
for this is already laid, judging from what we have heard here.
If we will be supreme in the stock exchange, we will attain the
<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><span class="pagenum" title="34"></span>same supremacy in the governments. Therefore it is necessary
to facilitate loans in order to get them into our hands all the
more. Wherever possible, we must take in exchange for capital,
mortgages on railroads, taxes, mines, regalia and domains. Furthermore,
the stock exchange is a means for the transfer of the
belongings of the small people to the hands of the capitalists,
by drawing them into stock gambling. Transactions in securities
are a splendid invention of our nation. Although the stock exchange
members cheat one another sometimes, it is the outsider
who always pays in the end.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The voice which resounded on the Paris Bourse became
silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Do the <em>zekenim</em> agree with the opinion of our brother?&#8217;
asked the Levite.</p>

<p>&#8220;A whisper of approbation was the answer to this question.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Representative of the tribe of Simeon, it is your turn now!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;A serious, dull voice resounded after this order. Each word
was pronounced slowly and thoughtfully:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ownership of land is always the iron-clad, everlasting possession
of every country. This in itself gives power, respect and
influence. Therefore, the Jews should secure the possibility of
acquiring real estate. It will not be hard to accomplish this,
if we acquire movable capital. Therefore it is necessary to
facilitate loans on land. Under the fear of scandal we will
destroy land wealth and minimize its importance. Ownership
of land should be mobilized, if lands are sold as other commodities.
The more we help in the breaking up of estates,
the more easily will they fall into our hands. Under the pretext
of relieving the poor classes, it is necessary to levy all taxes of
states and communities on the land owners. When the land is in
our hands, the labor of the Christian workers and farmers will
give us a tenfold income.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;He who did not belong to any tribe laughed sneeringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;This advice is good, but not new. Ask in Paris and in
Vienna, who owns the houses there?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;A whisper of approbation was heard again.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Tribe of Judah, your turn!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The voice that resounded was marked with conviction and
reminded one of the sound of the Thaller.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Industry, the power of the burgher, which hinders the Jewish
nation, must be paralyzed even as agriculture. The manufacturer
<a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a><span class="pagenum" title="35"></span>should be no better than an ordinary worker. The means
to accomplish this may be the unlimited freedom of trade. The
manufacturer will take the place of the artisan as he does not
have to work, only to speculate. The children of Israel can adapt
themselves to all branches of work. Their capital and dexterity
will be the substitute for right. Transforming the artisans into
our factory workers, we will be in a position to direct the masses
for our political purposes. Whoever resists this system will be
destroyed by competition. The senseless and ungrateful masses
will not support the artisans in this struggle, if commodities
are reduced in price to a certain extent.</p>

<p>&#8220;A noisy approbation of the new Sanhedrin showed that the
soundness of this advice had long been appreciated and even applied
in practice.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Now it is my turn,&#8217; said the representative of Levi&#8212;&#8216;I speak
in the name of the tribe of Aaron. The natural enemy of the
Jews is the Christian church. Therefore we must try to humiliate
it, we must instill into it free-thinking, <a name="typo4_a"></a>scepticism, and
conflicts. Therefore we will, first of all, start a war on the clergy,
we will try to arouse suspicion against it and ridicule it. The
main pillar of the church is the school. Therefore we must
gain influence over the young. Under the guise of progress and
the equal rights of all religions, we will destroy the study of
religion in Christian schools. Then the Jews may become
teachers in all schools; then religion will be taught at home.
And as there is little time left for that, the spirit of religion
will gradually decline, and eventually it will be destroyed altogether.
Agitation for the appropriation of property belonging
to the churches and schools, the transfer of church property to
the state, or (what is the same) into the hands of the Jews,
will be our reward!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Again approbation followed the words of the man who had
spoken. Nobody contradicted him and he announced:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Representative of the tribe of Isaachar, it is your turn!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now an old, trembling voice spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Let our brethren strive for the abolition of armed force.
The coarse military art is not for the sons of Israel. Not everyone
can be a Gideon! The army is for the defense of the throne
and the school of narrow patriotism. Not the sword, but reason
and money must rule. Therefore at every opportune instance,
it is necessary to help the downfall of the military class, to arouse
<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a><span class="pagenum" title="36"></span>suspicion in the masses against it, and to incite animosity against
one another. It is enough for the soldiers to do police duty and
to protect the wealthy from those who have nothing.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The Lion of Judah has spoken,&#8217; said the stranger angrily.
&#8216;David conquered Goliath. The nations will soon wear long
coats instead of military armour. A slap on the bourse will
be equivalent to a lost battle.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looked as though a storm was rising against this arrogant
sarcasm, but one word from the eldest restored them all to calm.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;This is the son of Baal! He may say whatever he pleases.
But he will do whatever is decided by the council of the
tribes.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The tribe of Zebulun may speak!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;A dull voice, like a storm in the distance, said as follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Our nation is conservative to its very root, and clings fast
to what is old. But our interest demands that we participate, or,
rather, direct the movements of nations. It is indisputable that
ours is a time of many reforms, whose main purpose is the
amelioration of the material condition of the needy classes. But
for this the propertied classes must sacrifice their capitals. Capital
is in the hands of the Jews. Therefore they must outwardly
take part in the movement and try to divert it from social and
political reforms. The masses themselves are blind and foolish,
and permit the shouters to rule over them. Who shouts more
loudly and more shrewdly than the Jews? Therefore our nation
has been the first on the platform, in the press, and in all Christian
communities! The more communities and meetings, the more
dissatisfaction and idleness. From this it follows inevitably that
the people grow poorer, that they become subjected to those
who have money, leading to the enrichment of the latter. Besides,
every movement makes us richer, for the smaller people
are ruined and are contracting debts. The unstability of the
foundation increases our power and our influence. Therefore
the support of every kind of dissatisfaction, every revolution,
increases our capital and brings us nearer to our goal.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;This terrible speech was followed by prolonged silence. Every
member of this secret Sanhedrim seemed to be thinking of its
terrible meaning. The son of Baal again laughed hoarsely.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Are you afraid of blood? It isn&#8217;t yours.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then one member of the gathering expressed his approval,
and all others followed his example.</p>

<p><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a><span class="pagenum" title="37"></span>&#8220;&#8216;Son of the tribe of Dan, your turn!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The answer bore the stamp of a Jew of the lower order:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Every business in which there is speculation and profit must
be in our hands. That is our natural right. First of all, we
must get control of the traffic in liquor, butter, wool, and bread.
Then we shall have in our hands agriculture, farming. We can
prepare bread everywhere, and if dissatisfaction and want should
arise, we can easily throw the blame on the government. Petty
wares, which give a great deal of trouble and yield very little
profit, we can leave in the hands of the Christians. Let them
work hard and suffer as the chosen people suffered for several
centuries.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;This speech scarcely needed approval. The Levite called
on the next one.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Tribe of Naphtali?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The following words rang out shrilly and with assurance:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;All governmental positions should be open to us. Once
this principle is established, the cunning and flattery of
the Jewish employees will help them to penetrate even there,
and they will have real influence. I am speaking only of the
posts which bring honor, power, and pre-eminence. Positions
which require work and knowledge may remain for the Christians.
Therefore the Jews may neglect positions of secondary
importance. Justice is very important for us, the law is a
great step forward. This occupation is suited to the cunning
and skill of our people and gives us influence and power against
our natural enemies. Why can&#8217;t a Jew be Minister of Education
as he has already been more than once Minister of Finance?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Remember the scaffold of Haman, the fate of Shushan and
Leopold!&#8217; said a warning voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why does the raven croak about the past which is so distant
and almost forgotten? More than one of our people has been a
Minister in France and respected by the King himself.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Approval was expressed in a tone of satisfied pride; then
the orator continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Our people must be among the legislators of the governments.
The laws of the goyim against the children of Israel
must be abolished. We will maintain the laws of our Fathers.
We need no longer any laws that would protect us. No. We
must concern ourselves about laws that will give us privileges.
A mild law respecting bankruptcy, promulgated in the interests of
<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a><span class="pagenum" title="38"></span>humanity, would be a golden mountain in our hands. First of
all we must see to it that the law regarding usury is abolished
in all countries under the pretext that money would thereby become
cheaper. Money is just such a commodity as others, and
the law should give us the right to regulate its price according
to our desire.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Now is the turn for the tribe of Benjamin.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What can I add to the counsel of such wise men? The
Jew should also make use of honors, and should be at the head
of all organizations that may give him honor without risks, and
he should engage in science and the arts which are more adapted
to the character of our people and which we can master more
easily. We can become good actors and philosophers, because
there is room for speculation in these domains. In the arts our
people will look after the reception and will burn incense to
ourselves. In science we will take up medicine and philosophy.
These afford opportunities for theories and speculation. A
physician penetrates the secrets of families and holds their lives
in his hands.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Tribe of Asher, your turn!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;We must demand free marriage between Jews and Christians.
Israel will only be the gainer, even though there be
an admixture of impure blood to a certain degree. Our sons
and daughters will marry into renowned and powerful Christian
families. We give money and thus have influence. The Christian
relationship cannot have a bad influence on us, while we can
exert a strong influence over them. That is one thing. Another
thing is that we respect the Jewish woman and we enjoy
the forbidden pleasure with the women of our enemies. We have
money, and for money we can get everything. A Jew must
never make a daughter of his own race his mistress. If he
should desire to sin against the Seventh Commandment he
should content himself with Christian girls.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What is the use of employing the beautiful girls of the
goyim in our stores if not for this?&#8217; angrily interposed the representative
of the evil spirit. &#8216;Whoever will not want to satisfy
our desire will get no work, consequently no bread. Go to the
large cities and you will see that they are not waiting for your
wise men&#8217;s orders. Substitute a contract for sacrament in the
marriage of Christians and their wives and daughters will come
to you still more readily.&#8217;</p>

<p><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a><span class="pagenum" title="39"></span>&#8220;The terrible cynicism of these words, touching such a delicate
subject, must have produced a profound impression, especially
since the views of the ancient doctrines were so strict on
the topic of moral purity.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What does the law say?&#8217; asked one of the twelve.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;For adultery with a woman of our own people&#8212;death; for
seducing a girl&#8212;a fine, if she was not betrothed; if she was
betrothed&#8212;death. But the law is not so rigorous with regard
to one who lives with a slave&#8212;her body belongs to her master.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Are the goyim better than our slaves?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;This explanation was followed by a whisper of approval.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The tribe of Manasseh may speak now!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The last of the orators lifted his hand and during his speech
he raised and lowered it, as if desiring thus to make a stronger
impression by his words. His voice was hoarse and unpleasant,
but he spoke skilfully and with assurance.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;If gold is the first power in the world, the press is the
second. Of what value are all the opinions and advice given here
without the aid of the press? We will attain our aim only when
the press is in our hands. Our people must direct the daily
publications. We are cunning, shrewd, and we possess money
which we know how to utilize for our purposes. We need great
political newspapers which mold public opinion&#8212;criticism, the
literature of the streets and the stage. In this way we will crowd
out the Christians step by step, and will dictate to the world
what it should believe in, what it should respect, and what it
should curse. We will repeat the sorrowful cry of Israel and
the complaints against the persecutions which are directed against
us. Then, even though each individual may be against us, the
masses, in their stupidity, will always be for us. With the press
in our hands, we can turn wrong into right, dishonesty into honesty.
We can shake all foundations, and separate families. We
can destroy faith in all that our enemies, until now, have believed.
We can ruin credits and arouse passions. We can declare war;
we can award fame or disgrace. We can uplift or ruin talent.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;When Israel shall have gold and the press in his hands,
we will be able to ask: &#8220;On what day will it please you to <em>put
on Atarah</em> (crown) which belongs to us by right, to erect
Shisse (?) and extend the Shebet (sceptre) over the nations of
the earth?&#8221;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;A noisy greeting followed these words and the agitated men
<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a><span class="pagenum" title="40"></span>who listened hardly understood for some time what was being
said at the meeting. At last the voice of the Levite called upon
all to be silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The Roshe-Bate-Aboth of the twelve tribes have uttered
words of wisdom. These words will be as pillars for the times
to come, if the son of him &#8220;who has not rest&#8221; will write these
words upon his memory and spread the seeds among the nation
of Israel in order that it may grow to be a mighty tree. They
will be the sword with which Israel will strike down his enemies.
Our posterity must share among themselves happiness, wealth
and power as it shared misfortune and dangers. They must
help one another. Wherever one of them places his foot, he
must drag another&#8212;his brother&#8212;along with him. If one
of them is unfortunate, others must help him, if he but lives
according to the law of our nation.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;He who was in prison for ten years, may become a rich
man to whom princes will bow, if only our people will not forsake
him. Where everybody is against us, all will be for us.
After forty years of wandering in the desert, the hand of Jehovah
brought us to power in the land of Canaan; the same hand will
lead us after forty-five times forty years from our misfortune
and miseries to rule over lands which are forty-five times vaster
than Canaan. If Israel shall obey the decision here adopted by
the Sanhedrin of the Caballah, our grandchildren, coming a
hundred years hence to the grave of the founder of our union,
will announce to him that they have indeed become the princes
of the world and that the promise made to the nation of Israel
has been fulfilled. Other nations will become his slaves! Renew
our oath, sons of the golden calf, and go to all lands of the
world.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The blue flame flared up brightly upon the grave of the
Rabbi; each of the thirteen threw upon the tomb a stone which
each carried under his cloak.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seemed to the doctor that on the top of the tombstone,
in the bluish flame, there appeared a monstrous golden figure
of an animal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he heard the same metallic sound that he had heard
when the light first appeared. Then impenetrable darkness covered
the cemetery.</p>

<p>&#8220;The white figures again slipped by among the tombstones.
The gates creaked softly.</p>

<p><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a><span class="pagenum" title="41"></span>&#8220;The clock in the tower struck two past midnight. The last of
the mysterious visitors knocked at the window and a hoarse
voice said (as though the speaker knew that the watchman was
not asleep):</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Close the house of life, watchman of those who are awaiting
the resurrection, and may your lips be sealed with the seal of
Solomon for a hundred years.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The scholar still lay motionless; he was afraid to stir; all
he had heard had made upon him such a dreadful impression.</p>

<p>&#8220;A noise near him indicated that his companion was rising.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;To concentrate in their hands all the capital of the nations
of all lands; to secure possession of all the land, railroads, mines,
houses; to be at the head of all organizations, to occupy the
highest governmental posts, to paralyze commerce and industry
everywhere, to seize the press, to direct legislation, public opinion
and national movements&#8212;and all for the purpose of subjugating
all nations on earth to their power! No! I shall
struggle against the golden calf and shall smash it to pieces as
Moses smashed it in the desert.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What we heard is a threat against all society. Here is
my hand, I will be your comrade in this struggle against the
power of gold.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Italian shook his head, but accepted the extended hand.
&#8216;No,&#8217; he said, &#8216;I want to act alone. There is a force which, if
properly directed, is not weaker than gold. That force is poverty
and her companion, labor. I shall call them out and lead
them into battle. Proud Israel! Beware! I shall put against
you the <em>Artel</em> (union) and Labor.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;And I,&#8217; said the scholar, with animation, &#8216;all that is lofty
and noble,&#8212;science, idealism, faith&#8212;I shall lead these against
this materialism.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;His comrade laughed:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Your ideals will crumble as clay striking against metal.
Only the forces of poverty and hunger can be the fighters that
will defeat the golden calf. Our ways part here; you will go
one way, and I another. My promise is fulfilled; but remember
your vow&#8212;be silent as to all that you have heard and seen
here!&#8217;&#8221;</p></div>

<p><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a><span class="pagenum" title="42"></span>This is the weird, fantastic &#8220;thriller&#8221; from which sprang
the Protocols. It is the first stage. According to this
story not only were there present at a secret meeting in
the Prague Cemetery, the representatives of the twelve
tribes of Israel, ten of which totally disappeared
nearly twenty-five centuries ago, but also the son of
&#8220;the accursed one,&#8221; the Devil, was there, making side-remarks
from time to time. His assigned function was
that of spreading the decisions of the Wise Men of Zion
among the Jews in order that they conquer the world.</p>

<p>Dr. Herman L. Strack, professor of theology at the
University of Berlin, one of the foremost Christian
authorities on theological and religious literature, commenting
on this Goedsche-Retcliffe concoction, says that
this tale of the ghostly convocation in the Jewish cemetery
at Prague, discloses no real knowledge of Judaism,
that the reference to mixed marriages indicates gross
ignorance of actual Jewish thought, and that the Hebrew
words supposed to have been employed by the spokesmen
for the various tribes appear to have been borrowed from
a dictionary. He also points to Goedsche-Retcliffe&#8217;s story
and the &#8220;Rabbi&#8217;s Speech&#8221; about to be mentioned as the
sources of the Protocols.</p>

<p>A number of years after this Russian translation of
the Goedsche-Retcliffe story appeared, Sir John Retcliffe,
alias Goedsche, deeming it important for his purpose of
adding fuel to the flame of anti-semitism that had been
lighted in Germany, undertook to convert this work of
fiction, this offspring of his imagination, into a statement
of fact. This led him to adopt the simple device of consolidating
into one continuous speech the dialogue contained
in his shilling shocker, and putting the speech into
the mouth of an imaginary Rabbi in such a way as to
make it appear to be an address delivered by him to a
secret convocation of Jews. And the very man who had
invented the speeches set down in his work of fiction
twenty years before, now vouched for the authenticity of
the obviously fabricated speech which he attributed to a
Rabbi who had his birth in the contorted mind of this
notorious forger.</p>

<p>A translation from the Russian of the apocryphal
&#8220;Rabbi&#8217;s Speech,&#8221; with the introductory note as published
in Russia by G. Butmi, in 1907, in a book entitled &#8220;The
Enemy of the Human Race,&#8221; dedicated by the author to
the Black Hundreds, will now be laid before the reader.

<p>To the Jewish People.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">*</a></p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1" class="fnlabel">*</a> NOTE. (Toward the end of the last century there appeared a book
in London by Retcliffe entitled &#8220;A Review of Political and Historical
Events During the Past Ten Years.&#8221; This work was translated into
French. The French periodical press, without waiting for the complete
translation of the book, reproduced certain parts of it because
they were of special interest. Thus the French newspapers and magazines
published translations from the English of an intensely interesting
speech, most edifying for Russia (from the Hebrew), delivered by one
of the Rabbis, THE AUTHENTICITY OF WHICH SPEECH IS
VOUCHED FOR BY THE ABOVE-MENTIONED AUTHOR. This inimitable
gem must in the eyes of Russians assume all the more importance
since it is brought out by that &#8220;highly civilized&#8221; humane
and practical country, England, which has given protection to the
Russian Jews against the unsuccessfully invented persecutions on the
part of the Russian government and people. This monstrous document
was sent at the time in printed form, in the French language, to the
editorial office of the Odessa newspaper &#8220;Novorosisk Telegraph&#8221; for
those who might want to examine the accuracy of the translation published
in No. 4996 of that newspaper, dated January 15, 1891, and reprinted
in No. 21 of the Petersburg newspaper &#8220;Znamya,&#8221; dated January
22, 1904. THE SPEECH RELATES TO THE TIME OF THE SANHEDRIN
OF 1869.)</p>

<p>[Paragraphs which are indented and parts in italics
were omitted in the Butmi version, but are given in the
French publication &#8220;Le P&eacute;ril Jud&eacute;o Ma&ccedil;onnique&#8212;I. Les
Protocols des Sages de Zion,&#8221; by Jouin, Paris, 1920.]</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Our fathers ordained the chosen ones in Israel to gather,
without fail, once every century, at the grave of our great Master
Caleb, the sainted Rabbi Simeon Ben Judah, whose great knowledge
is imparted to the elect of each generation to gain the
power over the whole world and authority over all the descendants
of Israel....</p></div>


<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;It is already eighteen centuries that the war of Israel
is being waged with the power which had been promised
to Abraham but which had been snatched away from
him by the <em>Cross</em>. Trampled under foot, humiliated by
his enemies, ceaselessly under threats of death, of persecution,
of rapine and violence of every sort, Israel has
not succumbed; and if he is dispersed over the whole
world it is because the whole world should belong to
him.</p></div>


<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;It has been for a few [eighteen] centuries now that our
learned men have been fighting against the Cross with courage
<a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a><span class="pagenum" title="46"></span>and persistence which nothing can break. Our people is rising
gradually and, with each day, its forces are growing. <em>It is to
us that this God of the day belongs, which was erected by Aaron
in the wilderness, this golden calf, this universal deity of the
epoch</em>.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we become, at last, the sole possessors of all the gold
<a name="typo4" id="typo4"></a>to be found on earth, the true power will practically be transferred
to our hands, and the promises made to Abraham will be
fulfilled. <em>Gold&#8212;is the greatest power on earth; it is might, reward,
the instrument of every authority, it is all man, both
fears and desires. This is the sole mystery, the most profound
science of that spirit with the aid of which the entire world is
ruled</em>. This is what the future holds in store. Eighteen centuries
have belonged to our enemies; this century and the following
must belong to us, the People of Israel, and will be
ours, without fail. Here, for the tenth time during a thousand
years of cruel and incessant struggle with our enemies, have
assembled at this cemetery; at the grave of the great Master,
Caleb, the sainted Rabbi Simeon Ben Judah, the elect of each
of the tribes of the Israelite people, in order to discuss and
agree upon, the means of making use, in the interests of
our cause, of all the tremendous mistakes and errors, which
our enemies&#8212;the Christians&#8212;have not ceased to commit. Every
time the new Sanhedrin (assembly) proclaimed and preached
merciless warfare against our enemies, but not once during the
past centuries did our forefathers succeed in concentrating in
our hands such an enormous quantity of gold [<em>and consequently
of power</em>] as the nineteenth century has given us. We
are therefore able, without any senseless illusions, to flatter ourselves
with the hope of attaining our goal before long, and we
can look forward with assurance into the very eyes of the
future.</p>

<p>&#8220;Persecutions and insults,&#8212;these sombre and tortuous times,
which the people of Israel bore with heroic patience,&#8212;have fortunately
come to an end, owing to the progress of civilization
among the Christians, and this progress is the best shield under
which we can hide and scheme, in order that we may cover
quickly and decisively the last leg of that distance which divides
us from our supreme aim. Let us cast a cursory glance at the
<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a><span class="pagenum" title="47"></span>economic situation of Europe and analyze the resources which
fell to the Israelites from the beginning of the present century,
owing to the concentration in their hands of the tremendous
<a name="typo5" id="typo5"></a>capital which is in their possession at the present time. It turns
out that in Paris, London, Vienna, Berlin, Amsterdam, Hamburg,
Rome, Naples, etc. [<em>and in all lands&#8212;the Rothschilds</em>], that
everywhere, the Israelites are the masters of the financial situation,
being as they are possessors of many billions, not to mention
localities of the second and third class where all the financial
funds are in their hands and not mentioning that, without their
direct influence, no financial operation, no work of any importance,
could be carried out anywhere at any time. At present,
all the emperors, kings and ruling princes are burdened
with tremendous debts incurred in order to be able to maintain
numerous standing armies [<em>to sustain their tottering thrones</em>].
The Bourse quotes and regulates these moneys, and we are the
full masters of the Bourse in all the centres of the globe. The
problem before us now is to facilitate even to a greater extent
the means of contracting these loans and thus to become the
sole managers of all valuables, after which the exploitation of
all their railroads, mines, forests, large factories and industrial
plants, as well as of all other (real property) including duties
and taxes, will fall into our hands, as a security for the capital
lent by us to the various States.</p>

<p>&#8220;Agriculture will forever remain the principal source of a
country&#8217;s wealth. The possession of large plots of land will
pave for us even a broader way to honors and will strengthen
our influence (over the highest officials of the country). From
this follows, that our efforts will be directed towards inducing
our brethren in Israel to make large agricultural purchases. We
must, therefore, do our utmost to break up large estates into
small parcels, in order to be able to purchase them in the easiest
and quickest way. Under the pretext of trying to help the working
classes, it is necessary to oppress the large landowners with
taxation in all its severity. When these possessions will thus
gradually be transferred into our hands, the whole labor of the
Christian proletariat will become for us a new source of tremendous
profits. <em>Since the Christian Church is one of our most
dangerous enemies, we must work tirelessly to weaken its influence,
and in order to accomplish this, it is necessary to use
all our efforts to implant in the Christian intellectual class ideas
<a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a><span class="pagenum" title="48"></span>of atheism, scepticism, dissension and to call forth religious
disputes among the newly-formed groups and sects of Christendom</em>.</p></div>


<div class="blockquot2"><p>&#8220;Logically, we must begin by depreciating the ministers
of this religion. Let us declare open war on them,
let us provoke suspicions on their devotion, on their
private conduct, and by ridicule and persiflage we shall
be right in the consideration attached to the state and
the costume of the priest.</p></div>


<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Every war, every revolution, every political and religious upheaval
brings nearer the moment when we shall attain the great
end for which we have been striving so long. Commerce and
speculation&#8212;these branches, most plentiful in their fruits,&#8212;must
never be suffered to slip out of the hands of the Israelites.</p></div>


<div class="blockquot2"><p>&#8220;... and once these branches have become identified
with us, we shall, through the flattery and perspicacity
of our executives, know how to penetrate to the prime
source of true influence and power. It is understood
that we are concerned only with those pursuits that entail
honors, power or privileges, for all those that require
knowledge, labor or disagreeable conditions, these can and
should be left to the Christians. The magistrature is an
institution of prime importance for us. The legal profession
develops most the faculty of civilization and
initiates one furthest in the affairs of our natural enemies,
the Christians, and it is through it that we can
subject them to our mercy. Why should not the Jews
become Ministers of Instruction when they have so often
been Ministers of Finance? The Jews must also aspire
to the rank of legislators with the object of abrogating
the laws made by the Goim, faithless sinners, against
the sons of Israel, the true believers, in their invariable
attachment to the holy laws of Abraham.</p>

<p>&#8220;Moreover, on this point, our plan is nearing the most
complete realization, for progress has nearly everywhere
recognized and accorded to us the same civic rights as
to Christians, but that which it is of importance to obtain,
that which must be the object of our ceaseless
efforts, is a law less severe on bankruptcy. We shall
make of it a gold mine more rich than were ever the
mines of California.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a><span class="pagenum" title="49"></span>&#8220;With this object in view the people of Israel must direct
its ambition towards those high offices of authority which have
the power to distribute honors and esteem. The most assured
way of attaining such offices is to have weight and importance in
the various industrial enterprises, financial and commercial operations,
and to be on guard for all pitfalls and temptations
which may lead to the prosecution of the sons of Israel in the
country&#8217;s courts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our people, in deciding upon one operation or another, must
be guided by wisdom and tact, which are the distinguishing
traits of its natural gifts. We must not remain passive to anything
that may aid us in gaining a place of honor in society;
philosophy, medicine, law, political economy&#8212;in other words, all
branches of science, art, literature&#8212;represent a wide field where
even our smallest successes, developing our abilities, will be of
great benefit to our cause.</p></div>


<div class="blockquot2"><p>&#8220;These vocations are inseparable from speculation.
Thus the production of a musical composition, even
though it be very mediocre, will furnish to our co-religionists
a plausible reason for elevating on a pedestal
and surrounding with a halo the Jew who will be the
author of it. As for the sciences, medicine and philosophy,
they must equally be a part of our intellectual
domain.</p></div>


<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;<em>To the physician are usually confided the most intimate secrets
of the family and he, therefore, holds in his hands the health
and life of our ancient enemies&#8212;the Christians.</em> We are obliged
to encourage matrimonial unions between Israelites and Christians,
for the people of Israel, risking no loss whatsoever from
such contact, will only gain from such unions.</p></div>


<div class="blockquot2"><p>&#8220;... The introduction of a certain quantity of impure
blood into our God-chosen race will not corrupt it.
Our daughters will furnish us with these marriages alliances
with Christian families that possess influence and
power. In exchange for the money that we give, it is
just that we obtain influence on everything that surrounds
us.</p></div>


<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Our relationship with the Christians will not make us deviate
from the path we have always been following; on the contrary,
with a certain degree of artfulness and cunning, this relationship
will gradually make us full masters of their destinies. <em>It is
<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a><span class="pagenum" title="50"></span>desirable, that the Israelites refrain from keeping concubines
of our holy faith and rather select Christian girls for the part.</em>
The substitution of the simple formality of a contract before
some civil power for the church ceremony is of the greatest
importance to us, because on this condition Christian women
will overflow our camp.&#8212;If gold is the first power on this earth,
then the second power is undoubtedly the press. But of what
significance is the latter without the former? Since we cannot
realize all the above-stated aims without the assistance of the
press, <em>it is absolutely necessary that the management of all the
newspapers and magazines of all the countries, be in our hands.
The possession of gold, of the press and of sufficient means for
the satisfaction of certain qualities of its soul, will make us
masters of public opinion and will subjugate to us the masses.</em></p>

<p>&#8220;Following this method on every step of our way with a persistence
which is one of our highest qualities, we will push the
Christians aside and reduce their influence to zero. We will
dictate to the world what it should believe, what it must
revere or despise. It is possible that persons will be found who
will arise against us; arming themselves, they will hurl insults
and curses at us; but the docile, ignorant masses will harken to
us and will take our part. <em>Once we become absolute masters
of the press, we will easily be able to refashion the ideas of
honor, of virtue, of faithfulness&#8212;and to deal the first blow to
the family-conception which is considered to this day as the
most sacred institution and which must be reduced to a state of
decay. We shall then be able to uproot the belief in that which
our enemies, the Christians, shall have worshipped until that
time and instead of that, having brought up the army in a
spirit of infatuation with the various passions, we shall openly
declare war upon everything that the gentiles are at present
revering and worshipping.</em></p>

<p>&#8220;May all this be understood and noted, and let every child of
Israel become imbued with its true principles. Then our might
will grow like a gigantic tree the branches of which will bear
fruits, known as riches, pleasure, power.</p></div>


<div class="blockquot2"><p>&#8220;... as a compensation for that hideous condition
which for long centuries has been the unique lot of the
people of Israel.</p></div>


<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;When one of us makes a step forward let the next one
follow him. If his foot slips let his co-religionists hasten to
<a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a><span class="pagenum" title="51"></span>support him. If an Israelite is trapped by the court of the
country in which he resides, his brethren in faith should use
all their efforts to get him out of trouble or to help him otherwise,
but on the condition that the Israelite in question acted
according to the laws which Israel observes strictly and guards
for so many centuries, and the precepts of our religion.</p></div>


<div class="blockquot2"><p>&#8220;Our people is conservative, faithful to the religious
ceremonies and usages which our ancestors have bequeathed
to us.</p></div>


<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;It is very important for us to pretend to be expounders and
protagonists of social questions prevalent at the time in a country,
especially of those whose aim it is to better the fate of the
workingman; but, in reality, our efforts must gravitate towards
possession and rule over the movements of public opinion.</p>

<p>&#8220;The blindness of the masses and the tendency of their
leaders to yield to oratory, as empty as it is loud, make them
easy prey for us and a double weapon for our popularity and
credit. With the aid of oratory, our speakers will be able to
make people believe our artificial enthusiasm which Christians
usually attain through the medium of genuine sentiment.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is necessary, to support as much as possible, the Proletariat
and to subjugate it to those in charge of the finances. Acting
in this manner, it will be for us to incite the masses, whenever
we shall need them. We will use them as weapons for upheavals
and revolutions and each of these catastrophes will move
our cause forward with gigantic strides and will bring us, with
a quick pace, nearer our goal&#8212;to reign over the entire world,
as it was promised by our Father Abraham.&#8221;</p></div>

out of many that might be selected, are taken from the
Goedsche-Retcliffe novel which were afterwards elaborated
and presented as facts.</em>]</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>FIRST STAGE OF THE LIE&#8212;THE NOVELETTE</p>

<p>If we will be supreme in the stock exchange, we will attain the
same supremacy in the governments. Therefore it is necessary to
facilitate loans in order to get them into our hands all the more.
Wherever possible, we must take in exchange for capital, mortgages on
railroads, taxes, mines, regalias (?) and domains. (Page 32.)</p>

<p>Ownership of land is always the iron-clad, everlasting possession of
every country. This in itself gives power, respect and influence.
Therefore the Jews should secure the possibility of acquiring real
estate. Therefore it is necessary to facilitate the loans on land. The
more we will help the breaking up of estates, the more easily they
will fall into our hands. (Page 33.)</p>

<p>Industry the power of the burgher, which hinders the Jewish nation
must be paralyzed even as agriculture. (Page 34.)</p>

<p>The natural enemy of the Jews is the Christian Church. Therefore
we must try to humiliate it, we must <a name="typo10" id="typo10"></a>instil into it free-thinking, scepticism,
and conflicts. Therefore we will first of all start a war on the
clergy, we will try to arouse suspicion against it and humiliate it.</p>

<p>Let our brethren strive for the abolition of armed force.... Not
the sword, but reason and money must rule. (Page 35.)</p>

<p>Our nation is conservative to its very root, and clings fast to the
old. But our interests demand that we participate, or, rather, direct
the movements of nations. It is indisputable that ours is a time of
many reforms, whose main purpose is the amelioration of the material
condition of the needy classes. But for this the propertied classes
must sacrifice their capital. Capital is in the hands of the Jews.
Therefore, they must outwardly take part in the movement and try to
divert it from social and political reforms. The masses themselves
are blind and foolish and permit the shouters to rule over them....
The instability of the foundation increases our power and our
influence. Therefore the support of every kind of revolution increases
our capital and brings us nearer to our goal. (Pages 36-37.)</p>

<p>Of what value are all the opinions and advice given here without the
aid of the press? We will attain our aim only when the press will be
in our hands. Our people must direct the daily publications.... We
need great political newspapers which will mold public opinion&#8212;criticism,
the literature of the street and the stage. In this way we will
crowd out the Christians step by step, and will dictate to the world
what it should believe in, what it should respect and what it should
curse. We will repeat the sorrowful cry of Israel and the complaints
against the persecutions which are directed against us.... With the
press in our hands we can turn wrong into right, dishonesty into
honesty. We can shake all foundations and separate families. We can
destroy faith in all that our enemies believed until now. We can ruin
credits and arouse passions. We can declare war; we can give fame or
disgrace. We can uplift or ruin talent. (Page 43.)</p></div>

<p>When we become at last the sole possessors of all the gold to be found
on earth, the power will practically be transferred to our hands, and
the promises made to Abraham will be fulfilled. Gold&#8212;is the greatest

Zion,&#8221; published by the Beckwith Company, New York, 1920.</p>

<p>All the wheels of the government mechanism are driven by the motor
which is in our hands, and that motor is&#8212;gold. (Prot. 5.)</p>

<p>To make it possible for liberty definitely to disintegrate and ruin
Gentile society, industry must be placed upon a speculative basis.
The result will be that all products extracted from industry from the
soil will not remain in their hands but will pass through speculation
into our possession. (Prot. 4.)</p>

<p>The aristocracy of the Gentiles as a political force has passed away....
But as owners of land, they are harmful to us in that they are
independent in their sources of livelihood. Therefore at all costs we
must deprive them of their land. The best means to attain this is
to increase land taxes and mortgage indebtedness. These measures
will keep land ownership in a state of unconditional subordination.
(Prot. 6.)</p>

<p>See second quotation above.</p>

<p>At the same time it is necessary to encourage trade and industry
vigorously and especially speculation, the function of which is to act
as a counterpoise to industry.... It is necessary for industry to
deplete the land both of laborers and capital, and, through speculation,
transfer all the money of the world into our hands, thereby throwing
the Gentiles into the ranks of the proletariat. (Prot. 6.)</p>

<p>It is for this reason that we must undermine faith, eradicate from
the minds of the Gentiles the very principle of God and soul and
replace these conceptions by mathematical calculations and material
desires. (Prot. 4.)</p>

<p>We have taken good care long ago to discredit the Gentile clergy
and thereby to destroy their mission, which at present might hamper
us considerably. Their influence over people diminishes daily. (Prot. 17.)</p>

<p>It is indispensible for our purposes that, as far as possible, wars
should bring no territorial advantages. This will shift war to an
economic footing and nations will perceive the strength of our superiority
in the aid we render. Such a condition of affairs will place
both sides under the control of our international agents with their
million eyes, whose vision is unhampered by any frontiers. (Prot. 2.)</p>

<p>We will represent ourselves as the saviors of the laboring classes
who have come to liberate them from this oppression by suggesting
that they join our army of socialists, anarchists, communists, to whom
we always extend our help under the guise of the fraternal principles
of the universal solidarity of our social masonry.... (Prot. 3.)</p>

<p>We will adopt for ourselves the liberal side of all parties and all
movements and provide orators who will talk so much that they will
tire the people with their speeches until they turn from orators in
disgust. (Prot. 5.)</p>

<p>In 1905 the second edition of Serge Nilus&#8217;s book appeared,
printed on government presses at Tsarskoye Selo,
containing a new and elaborated version of the protocols.</p>

<p>The translators of the Nilus protocols published in his
1905 edition, a copy of which is in the British Museum,
have deliberately omitted numerous passages from his
prologue and epilogue. These passages show clearly the
purpose of the volume. Nilus writes: &#8220;We may perhaps
be reproached, and justly, for the apocryphal character
of the document presented. But if it were possible
to demonstrate its accuracy by documents or through the
testimony of trustworthy witnesses, if it were possible to
unveil the faces of those who are at the head of the
world conspiracy and who hold its bloody strings in their
hands, then the very &#8216;mystery of lawlessness&#8217; would be
infringed upon, and it must remain intact until its incarnation
in the &#8216;son of destruction.&#8217;&#8221; Then he goes on
to say that the world is rushing towards its destruction,
and that there is only one force that can save it, and that
is the &#8220;God-Anointed Tsar of Russia.&#8221; The omitted
portions of the Nilus book show distinctly that it is a
work of propaganda for the Russian autocracy. Nilus
denounced Leo Tolstoy, the emancipation of women, and
all movements leading toward progress.</p>

<p><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a><span class="pagenum" title="56"></span>The editors of the protocols in Europe and America,
realizing that these passages would disclose to intelligent
people the real motive of the Nilus protocols and
thus discredit them, have deliberately omitted them in
the translations.</p>

Nilus book, which are his own utterances and do not

see or hear. These &#8216;Protocols&#8217; at a first cursory glance might
seem to be what we are accustomed to call truisms; they are more
or less commonplaces although expressed with a boldness and
a hatred not altogether customary in commonplaces. A proud,
deeply-rooted, ancient, for a long time secretly growing,&#8212;and
what is more frightful than all,&#8212;a religious rage boils between
the lines, bubbling over and escaping from the overfilled vessel
of violence and vengeance, already approaching complete triumph.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be mentioned, by the way, that the title of the manuscript
does not fully justify the contents: these are not protocols
of a meeting but rather the report of someone in power, divided
into parts which are not even always logically connected: the
impression remains that this is a fragment of something much
more significant, the beginning of which has been lost. The
origin of the manuscript, as given by us above, furnishes sufficient
explanation of this.</p>

<p><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a><span class="pagenum" title="57"></span>&#8220;We may perhaps be reproached, and justly, for the apocryphal
character of the document presented. But if it were possible
to demonstrate its accuracy by documents or through the testimony
of trustworthy witnesses, if it were possible to unveil
the faces of those who are at the head of the world conspiracy
and who hold its bloody strings in their hands, then the very
&#8216;mystery of lawlessness&#8217; would be infringed upon, and it must
remain intact until its incarnation in the &#8216;son of destruction.&#8217;
In the complexity of the present criminally-earthly process <em>we
must not search for direct evidence</em>; we are forced to content
ourselves with indirect proof and of these it seems that the
attention of the sad Christian observer is fully satisfied.</p>

<p>&#8220;The history of the Rothschilds show that the whole republican
era of France is due to Zion and that not a single one of
those elected to office has to this time ever done what he promised
to do, if the demands of his electors did not coincide with
the plans of the government of Zion.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has become of unfortunate France!...</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Let him who has ears, listen!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times
some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits,
and doctrines of devils;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared
with a hot iron;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from
meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving
of them which believe and know the truth.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is not this Tolstoy and his followers scattered over the whole
world?!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In every age there have been many women &#8216;drowning in sin
and led on by various lusts&#8217;: the ebb and flow of this sin in
woman&#8217;s heart characterized whole epochs of particular human
defection but at no time of the seeming triumph of sin have
there been women &#8216;constantly studying&#8217;&#8212;this sign represents entirely
a universal inheritance and is an exclusive characteristic
of our epoch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is ignorant of the so-called &#8216;woman question,&#8217; the emancipation
of woman, that has already succeeded in breaking up
so many families and which threatens an even greater disruption
in the future?!...</p>

<p><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a><span class="pagenum" title="58"></span>&#8220;For the sake of some phantom the bride and mother abandons
her true mission. Is not this the greatest and most unfortunate
world revolution!&#8221;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>&#8220;The Sanhedrin was unseizable and invulnerable. It carried
the roots of evil from France into Scotland, where under a
different name it entered into a league with united England,
with whom, after having let it in behind the curtain of its
secret and having declared deadly war to papism, it cooperates
even to the present day, helping out England in her exploits
over the whole world with its capital and concessions, in which
respect the Sanhedrin was never penurious.</p>

<p>&#8220;As to the question why England and no other European government
was chosen as the point of resistance for the fighting
Sanhedrin, the Sanhedrin gives no reply. We are inclined to
think that the cause is to be found in the isolated island position
of the sufficiently strong government, and perhaps in the kinship
between the English and the Jews.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">*</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Having covered the whole of Europe with a network of
Masonic lies (the symbol of the temple of Solomon is preserved
for them also), possessing countless millions, in face of the
general fall of the Christian spirit among the European peoples,
in whom there was artificially spread and supported the cult of
the golden calf; having poisoned the idea of godliness and
spirituality in the heart of the peoples by &#8216;scientific&#8217; theories, the
Sanhedrin&#8212;the priest of the golden idol created by it, has gained
control of the spiritual life of all Europe, and with its help,
with the help of its gold, with the sold consciousness of those
standing at the helm of power, and with the help of its faithful
ally&#8212;England, it has corrupted and perverted all the political
foundations of Europe, and through them the well-being and
spiritual health of its population. The French revolution, glorified
by the Masonized historical science of &#8216;greatness&#8217; and the
fall of the &#8216;great&#8217; Napoleon have shown to the world the significance
and strength of the Sanhedrin. But the world did not
recognize the new manifestation of Satan: at that time the
words of truth of the Evangel and the apostolic foresight had
become alien to him.&#8221;</p></div>


<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3" class="fnlabel">*</a> As is known, there is a scientific theory which tries to prove that
the English are the descendants of one of the scattered tribes of
Israel. The Sanhedrin which directs the course of contemporary science,
is not ashamed to produce whatever theories are advantageous
to them. According to certain tenuous evidences in the air it seems
that a new theory is being produced according to which the honor of
birth relationship with the God-elected Sanhedrin is extended to
America and ... Japan. AVIS A L&#8217;ANGLETERRE!...)</p>

<h3>FORGERS DISAGREE</h3>

<h4>The Butmi Protocols&#8212;&#8220;Representatives of Zion&#8221; Not to be Confounded
with &#8220;Zionists&#8221;&#8212;Butmi Contradicts Nilus&#8212;Plan
for World Conquest Conceived 929 B.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;E.&#8212;The &#8220;Symbolic
Snake&#8221;&#8212;Universal Suffrage a Jewish Device&#8212;Every Jew
Familiar with Plot.</h4>


<p>In the book issued by G. Butmi to which reference has
been made, and which contains the &#8220;Rabbi&#8217;s Speech&#8221;
already considered, there is to be found still another version
of the protocols. Butmi was a Black Hundred
writer. It appeared in 1907 and was dedicated to the
Black Hundred organization. Appropriately enough it
was published by the Society of Deaf and Dumb, as will
be seen from the facsimile reproduction of the title page.
With exceeding <em>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</em> Butmi published the forged speech
attributed by Retcliffe-Goedsche to a Jewish Rabbi as
proof of the genuineness of the protocols, and side by
side with the fabricated speech appears the Butmi version
of the protocols which had undergone further
changes subsequent to the publication in 1905 of &#8220;the
documents&#8221; by Serge Nilus.</p>

<p>The headlines over the protocols in the Butmi 1907
version read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;PROTOCOLS TAKEN OUT OF THE SECRET DEPOSITORIES
OF THE MAIN OFFICE OF ZION.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;(Extracts from ancient and modern protocols of the Sages
of Zion of the Universal Organization of Freemasons.)&#8217;</p></div>

<p><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a><span class="pagenum" title="60"></span>Thus the Protocols were in 1907 presented by G. Butmi,
dedicated to the Black Hundreds, as Masonic, not as
Jewish documents. In his introduction the author says,
in part, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;&#8216;These secret protocols were secured with great difficulty in
fragmentary form, and were translated into Russian in December,
1901. It is almost impossible to get at the secret depositories
again where they are hidden, and therefore they cannot be reinforced
by definite information as to the place, day, month, year,
where and when they were composed.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The reader who is more or less familiar with the secrets of
Freemasonry will draw from the general character of the criminal
plot, outlined in the protocols, the conclusion as to their authenticity,
and from several details he will suppose with great certainty
that the mentioned protocols were taken from the documents
of the Masonic lodge of Egyptian ritual, or Mizraim,
which is joined mostly by Jews....</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;But the above-mentioned failure to mention the time and
place where the protocols were composed might call forth in
the reader, who is entirely unfamiliar with the abominations of
Masonic doctrines, doubts as to the authenticity of these documents.&#8217;&#8221;</p></div>

<p>At the end of the &#8220;protocols&#8221; published in this edition
by Butmi, in 1907, there appears a note by the man who
declares that he had secured and translated the documents
from the French, on December 9, 1901, and in the
very first two lines of his note, he states that the representatives
of Zion mentioned in the documents are not
to be confounded with the representatives of the Zionist
movement. The Russian mystic Serge Nilus, in his later
editions, connected the documents with the Zionist Congress
in Basle and with the head of the Zionist movement,
Dr. Theodore Herzl.</p>

<p>The translator, as do Nilus and Lutostansky, also gives
a version of &#8220;the political plan devised by the Wise Men
of Zion.&#8221; This translator, however, states that the &#8220;political
<a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a><span class="pagenum" title="61"></span>plan was conceived 929 years before the birth of
Christ. It was invented by Solomon and Judean sages in
theory.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Translator&#8217;s Note.</em></p>

<p>&#8220;The expounded protocols are signed the representatives of
Zion (<em>do not confound them with the representative of the
Zionist movement</em>). They were taken out of a whole book of
protocols, the entire contents of which it was impossible to copy
because of the short time allowed the translator for reading
these protocols. A small appendix was attached to them and
a plan of conquering the world by the Jews by peaceful means.
Those protocols and the Sketch were taken from the secret
depositories of the Main Office of Zion, now located on French
territory.</p>

<p>&#8220;The above-mentioned sketch contained the entire political
plan of Zion with regard to the stages to be passed through
by this movement and to the means of passing from one to
another. The aforesaid political plan was conceived 929 years
before the birth of Christ. It was invented by Solomon
and the Judean Sages in theory; according to historical events,
it was elaborated and enlarged by their followers initiated in
this plan.</p>

<p><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a><span class="pagenum" title="62"></span>&#8220;These sages decided to conquer the world peacefully for
Zion, with the cunning of the Symbolic Snake, whose head
should be composed of the Jewish Government initiated in the
plans of the Wise Men (always masked even to their people),
and the body&#8212;the Jewish nation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Crawling into the bosom of governments, this snake has
undermined or eaten away all non-Jewish governmental powers,
according to their growth, in various continents, but particularly
in Europe, which he should do also in the future, following
exactly the outlines of the plan until the cycle of the road
travelled by it will close by the return of the head of the Snake
to Zion,&#8212;that is, until this snake will include in the sphere of
its circle all Europe, and through Europe the whole world,
utilizing all forces conquered by economic means in order to
draw the other continents into the sphere of its cycle....</p>

<p>&#8220;For instance, the economic theory of the ballot system has
made it possible to carry out everything that was desirable in
the interests of the elevation of Zion. The Jewish authorities
commenced to act by means of bribing or by instigating the
majority of votes as soon as they succeeded to manage so that
the decisions of that majority became the determining factor in
questions of national life. The crowd always in need, or the
greedy intelligent class, short-sighted liberals and other blind
people have also rendered good service to Zion. Therefore the
republican is the most desirable and convenient form of government
for Zion because it gives full sway for the activities of the
armies of Zion&#8212;for anarchists of thought and action, called
socialists.</p>

<p>&#8220;All that which is outlined above is the work of the hands
of the nation without a territory, constituting but a drop in the
ocean of humanity, but possessing the most ideal Government,
every member of which is familiarized with the plan of action
worked out in the course of centuries, from which he cannot
deviate. The politics of the goyim is the politics of accidental
circumstances, engineered by the Jews, and tends not towards
perfecting the affairs of the state, but towards struggle for the
sake of greed, or more often for the personal aggrandizement
of the administrators.</p>

<p>&#8220;From this it is clear, on whose side there must be victory
and the guidance of the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;Translation from the French, December 9, 1901.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>As the writings of Sergius Nilus are typical of the
&#8220;literature&#8221; produced under the auspices of the Russian
Black Hundred organizations which sought to save the
Czar&#8217;s throne by pogroms, I examined a large number
of publications brought out in Russia during the
period when &#8220;the Russian Mystic,&#8221; Sergius Nilus, published
his pretended discovery, the &#8220;Protocols.&#8221; His book,
&#8220;The Great in the Small and anti-Christ,&#8221; appeared in
1905 after the Russo-Japanese War, when the Russian
revolutionists made an attempt to overthrow the Czar&#8217;s
government. A new organization was formed for the support
of the Russian throne. It was known as &#8220;the Union
of the Russian People,&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;the Black Hundred,&#8221;&#8212;whose
program was Jew-baiting. It was then that Russia
adopted a definite, anti-Jewish policy of <a name="typo6" title="typo6"></a>vengeance&#8212;a
pogrom policy. The &#8220;Black Hundred&#8221; held the Jews responsible
for Russia&#8217;s defeat in the war and for the attempted
revolution,&#8212;and neither the Czar nor his loyal
organization of the &#8220;Black Hundred&#8221; ever forgave Count
Sergius Witte, who won for Russia at the Portsmouth
Peace Conference what she had lost on the battlefields, for
inducing Nicholas II to grant a constitution to Russia.
&#8220;The Black Hundreds&#8221; nicknamed Witte &#8220;the Jewish
Count of Portsmouth.&#8221; They attacked him and attempted
to assassinate him. They assassinated at that
time two Jewish members of the Duma, Yollos and
Hertzenstein. It was during that period of Judophobomania
that Sergius Nilus published his book introducing
the &#8220;Protocols&#8221; in Russia.</p>

<p><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a><span class="pagenum" title="67"></span>In my investigation I naturally examined the works
of the Russian arch anti-Semite, Ippolit Lutostansky, who
first accused the Jews of the most despicable crimes, and
then, in 1882, after the occurrence of the pogroms in the
south of Russia, wrote a volume retracting all his previous
anti-Jewish accusations, and declaring anti-Semitism to be
nothing but an outgrowth of ignorance and malice. Several
years later he resumed his anti-Semitic agitation and
became one of the most vicious vilifiers of the Jewish
people on the eve of the notorious Beilis affair which was
staged by the Russian government for the purpose of
discrediting the Jews and of justifying the Russian governmental
anti-Jewish policy before the world. After the
collapse of the Beilis prosecution, which involved the
absurd charge of ritual murder, Lutostansky approached
several prominent wealthy Jews with an offer to retract
his new charges against the Jews, provided they would
pay him a certain amount of money for his book. The
Jews declined to have anything to do with the charlatan
who had caused so much harm to the Jews of Russia by
his monstrous accusations. His works attracted special
attention because of the fact that they were endorsed and
supported by Russian Grand Dukes and by the Dowager
Empress of Russia.</p>

<p>While examining one of his books entitled, &#8220;The Talmud
and the Jews,&#8221; published in 1907, in which he promised
the publication of &#8220;the Protocols of the Wise Men
of Zion&#8221; in his forthcoming volume, I came upon an
amazing passage in his introduction, outlining an alleged
secret plan of the Jews to gain world domination, which
<a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a><span class="pagenum" title="68"></span>I find reproduced, word for word, with but a few phrases
changed, in the epilogue of &#8220;the Russian mystic,&#8221; Sergius
Nilus. Did Sergius Nilus plagiarize Lutostansky? Or
was it Lutostansky who plagiarized Nilus? Or were they
one and the same person? At any rate, both served the
purposes of the &#8220;Black Hundreds&#8221; against the Jews, and
both employed the same weapons.</p>

<p>Here is a translation of Lutostansky&#8217;s introduction:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>From Lutostansky&#8217;s Introduction, 1907</p>

<p>EXPLANATION OF THE ZIONIST SYMBOLIC SNAKE</p>

<p>&#8220;The political plan represented in the form of a snake is very
old and was devised by the Judaean sages in theory, and in the
course of historical developments it is elaborated and augmented
by their initiated followers. These sages decided to conquer the
world peacefully for Zion, by the cunning of the symbolic snake.
The head of the snake represents the sages of Zion, and the
body&#8212;the Judaean nation. Crawling into the bosoms of governments,
this snake undermines eats away all non-Judaean governmental
forces, as they grow on various continents, but especially
in Europe, which it is to do also in the future, carefully following
the outlined plan, until the cycle of the road travelled
by it is completed by the return of the head of the snake to
Zion,&#8212;that is until this snake will include within the sphere of
its circle the whole of Europe, and through Europe the whole
world. First of all they are endeavoring to introduce everywhere
irreligion and moral decadence, utilizing all forces they have
won economically in order to drag the other continents into the
sphere of their cycle. As the return of the head of the snake
could be accomplished only over the razed ruins of the governmental
power of all European countries, through the collapse
of this power, through economic disorganization and ruin, introduced
by Zion everywhere by means of moral decadence. Corruption
is introduced with the aid of Jewesses under the guise
of French or Italian women, who even undergo fictitious baptism
for these purposes and then become the wives of prominent
men, like the biblical Esther, and they are always accompanied
by their Mordecais, and make their politics for the good of the
<a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a><span class="pagenum" title="69"></span>Jews. These so-called French and Italian women are the best
carriers of immorality from place to place. These women are
used for those who, because of them, are always in need of
money, and therefore willingly barter their conscience to secure
money at any cost. The money is reality only loaned to such
conscience-barterers, for it quickly comes back to the hands of
<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a><span class="pagenum" title="70"></span>those loaned the money, as it is squandered with the aid of
these women soon after they receive it. The Zionist nets are
spread out on all the roads of the goyim (gentiles) and the
cycle of the snake is moving along in the Twentieth century with
the speed of an express train towards its goal.</p>

<p>&#8220;The complete outline of all the secret protocols of the Zionist
Jewish sages, the entire plan of the conquest of the whole world,
will be included in the next (seventh) volume of &#8216;The Talmud
and the Jews.&#8217;&#8221;</p></div>

Sergius Nilus&#8217;s epilogue taken from the copy of the
&#8220;Protocols&#8221; in the British Museum, from which the
American translation was made.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>From the Nilus Epilogue, 1917</p>

<p>&#8220;According to secret Jewish Zionism, a political plan was devised
in theory for the peaceful conquest of the world for Zion,
by Solomon and other sages already 929 years before the birth
of Christ. In the course of historical developments, the plan
was elaborated and augmented by their followers initiated in
this affair. These sages decided to conquer the world peacefully
for Zion, by the cunning of the symbolic snake, whose
head should constitute the government of the Jews initiated in
the plans of the sages (always masked even from their own
people) and the body&#8212;the Judean nation. Penetrating the bosoms
of the governments encountered on the way, this snake
has undermined and eaten away (overthrowing) all governments,
non-Jewish forces according to their growth.</p>

<p>&#8220;This it should also do in the future, carefully following the
outlined plan, until the cycle of the road travelled by it is completed
by the return of the head of the snake to Zion, and until
the snake will thus include and concentrate in the sphere of its
circle the whole of Europe, and through Europe the rest of the
world, utilizing all forces of conquest and by economic means
in order to subject also the other continents to its influence, to
the influence of its cycle. The return of the head of the snake
could be accomplished only over the razed plains of the governmental
power of all the European countries,&#8212;that is through
<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a><span class="pagenum" title="71"></span>economic disorganization and ruin, introduced by Zion everywhere
by means of spiritual decadence and moral turpitude,
chiefly, with the aid of Jewish women under the guise of French,
Italian and Spanish women, the best introducers of immorality
into the conduct of the rulers of nations. Women in the hands
of Zion serve as bait for those, who owing to them are always
in need of money, and therefore barter their conscience in order
to get money at any cost. This money, in fact, is only loaned to
them, for it quickly comes back to the hands of bribing Zion
through these very women, and at the same time they have
secured slaves for Zion.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>A comparison of these pages shows that Nilus merely
added to Lutostansky&#8217;s version the statement to be found
in Butmi&#8217;s version that the political plan for the peaceful
conquest of the world for Zion, was devised in theory by
Solomon and other sages <em>929 years before the birth of
Christ</em>. Lutostansky said in 1907 that &#8220;the head of the
snake represents the sages of Zion, and the body&#8212;the
Judean nation,&#8221; while Nilus said that the &#8220;head should
constitute the government of the Jews initiated in the plans
of the sages (always masked even from their own people)
and the body&#8212;the Judean nation.&#8221; Thus the sages of
Zion were transformed by Nilus into &#8220;the government
of the Jews&#8221; in order to connect the &#8220;political plan&#8221; all
the more closely with the &#8220;protocols.&#8221; The American
editors have omitted this part of the Nilus epilogue, evidently
because it seemed even to them too absurd for
American consumption.</p>

<p>All of the literature about the &#8220;protocols&#8221; that appeared
in various parts of the world in 1920 is based on
the &#8220;documents&#8221; vouched for by the mysterious Sergius
Nilus, and fortified by the irresponsible Jew-baiter and
intellectual pervert Ippolit Lutostansky.</p>

<p>That the Nilus-Lutostansky-Butmi campaign was just
what the Tsarist government desired may be seen from
<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a><span class="pagenum" title="72"></span>the photographic reproduction of the letter sent to
Lutostansky by Grand Duke Michael, who was regarded
as the most liberal among the Russian Grand Dukes. The
letter appears together with other letters of congratulation
from members of the Imperial family in the volume
containing the passages quoted above.</p>

<p>For the benefit of the antisemitic agitators in England,
such as the editors of The Morning Post, The New Witness,
The Spectator, Blackwood&#8217;s Magazine, and a number
of irresponsible publications needless to name, it will
prove instructive and interesting to reproduce a few additional
passages from the same volume, in order that they
may know and appreciate not only what that authority
<a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a><span class="pagenum" title="73"></span>said concerning the Jews but also what he thought of the
English.</p>

<p>On pages 279, 282 and 283 of volume six of &#8220;The
Talmud and the Jews,&#8221; after outlining the alleged Jewish
plot to gain world dominion, Lutostansky wrote, in 1907:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The English are typical pure-blooded Israelites. In ancient
times they were all red-headed, as we see from the descriptions
in the Bible and the New Testament. The characteristic of the
Israelites is known to the whole world under the sun. The
characteristic of the English, if we follow it closely, does not
differ from the Jewish in the slightest degree. Who are the
English? This question has long occupied the minds of many
people in Europe, as well as in England itself. The universal
trading traits of the sons of Albion, their looting politics, based
on unfair business, and many other characteristic traits of the
nation which are not peculiar to any of the other European nations
that are even less cultured and civilized <a name="typo7" id="typo7"></a>that the English&#8212;all
these have long seemed very suspicious and have drawn
attention to a certain kinship between the Anglo-Saxons and
the Jews. During the past two decades, in England and America,
also on the European continent, particularly in France, a whole
literature has been created, proving on the basis of many facts,
suppositions and historical references, that the origin of the
Anglo-Saxon race is not Germanic, but Semitic, that the English
are the direct descendants of the Israelites, thrown by historic
fate to the shores of the distant Albion....</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, the lion of Judah, has become the British lion and
adorns the coat of arms of the King of England. The harp
of King David to this day represents the coat of arms of Ireland....</p>

<p>&#8220;But not only are the kings of England the direct descendants
of Jewish Kings, they are even seated on the throne of David,
on which the ancient Jewish kings were married. This throne,
on which Jacob fell asleep on that night when he dreamt of
the ladder and when the Lord promised the kingdom to his
posterity. This stone, called &#8216;the Stone of Fate,&#8217; which served
for the weddings of Jewish Kings, was brought to Ireland by
the prophet Jeremiah. Tergus (?) transferred it to Scotland,
whence it was taken to London.</p>

<p><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a><span class="pagenum" title="74"></span>&#8220;It is curious to note that many prophecies about this fate
of Israel fit England absolutely, as for instance, the prophesy
that Israel will become a great nation, a kingdom on islands,
ruling over large colonies.</p>

<p>&#8220;North America is inhabited by the tribe of Menasseh of
whom it was said in ancient prophesy that he will become a &#8216;separate
great nation.&#8217; The very word <em>saxon</em> is derived from <em>Isaacson</em>,
that is the son of Israel....</p>

<p>&#8220;As one of the signs of kinship between the population of
England and ancient Israel, we cannot help pointing out the
close similarity between the English and Jewish tribes, the
similarity in their manner of speech, and above all, trading as
the fundamental characteristic of both nations....</p>

<p>&#8220;The particular reverence in which the English hold the Bible
smacks of the Old Testament of the Jews. Even the preference
on the part of the English for long clothes indicates something
Asiatic....</p>

<p>&#8220;Arousing of late the unanimous indignation of the whole
civilized world, the English at the same time call forth amazement
at their traits, instincts and aspirations which positively
make them a monster in the family of cultured and civilized
European nations. As the proverb says, there is no family without
a black sheep. Every monstrosity, however, is to be explained&#8212;Jews
come from Jews.&#8221;</p></div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>This interesting information is taken from Lutostansky&#8217;s
book. Nilus and other writers of the Black Hundred
camp pictured England in the same manner immediately
after 1905. It was then the Russian governmental
policy to discredit England and the Jews in the
eyes of the Russian people, and the Black Hundreds were
employed by the Tsar as the medium through which to
carry on this agitation.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Black Hundreds&#8221; started their campaign in 1905,
but their work was so venomous, so absurd and so steeped
in ignorance that there were few people even in Russia
who paid any attention to it.</p>

<p>That the Nilus protocols which were published by the
Black Hundreds were not taken seriously in Russia by
the reactionaries or even by the Black Hundreds who
<a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a><span class="pagenum" title="75"></span>sought every means of discrediting the Jews, may be
gathered from the fact that in the most stupendous anti-Jewish
plot ever devised by the Russian government to
justify Jewish massacres,&#8212;the notorious Beilis case,&#8212;the
protocols published eight years previously were never used
by the prosecution, even though it resorted to every foul
means that could be conjured up of slandering and vilifying
the Jewish people. The very persons who were instrumental
in spreading the &#8220;protocols&#8221; in Russia in 1905
seemed to have realized that the false accusations which
they contained were too transparent and too clumsy to
deceive even the most credulous, and so they were discarded.</p>

<p>But suddenly, after the armistice, a new edition of the
Nilus book containing the &#8220;protocols,&#8221; dated 1917, made
its appearance as suitable to the chaotic conditions that
prevailed in Russia and during the past two years, as
has been shown, it was reproduced in various countries.
This time the antisemitic propagandists are trying to
connect the &#8220;protocols&#8221; directly with Theodore Herzl
and the Zionist movement. The war, the peace treaty
and bolshevism are characterized as the fulfillment of
these &#8220;protocols&#8221; which they say had been devised no
less than 929 years before the birth of Christ, by Solomon
and other Sages. The present &#8220;protocols&#8221; have been
elaborated from the &#8220;Retcliffe-Goedsche&#8221; versions by the
Russian secret police department and the Black Hundreds
who ascribed all the evils in the world to the Jews.</p>

<p>The Black Hundred writer, G. Butmi, whose book
&#8220;Enemies of the Human Race,&#8221; containing the fabricated
speech by a &#8220;famous Rabbi&#8221; side by side with the &#8220;protocols,&#8221;
gives several characteristic passages in his introduction
that will convey to the reader a clear conception
of the type of men who have stood behind the movement
<a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a><span class="pagenum" title="76"></span>to discredit the Jews through the so-called &#8220;protocols.&#8221;</p>

<p>On page 36 of this volume, Butmi wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The French Revolution, which ended in the execution of
Louis XVI in 1793, was engineered by England with the aid of
the Jews and the Judaized Masons. Only the Jews profited by
the French Revolution, even as they profited by the English
Revolution, attaining in the general turmoil equal rights with
the native population of France.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Discussing the traits of the English people and finding
a similarity between them and the Jews, Butmi said on
page 38:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;The British traits are well known all over the world&#8212;their
exceptional selfishness, their inhuman cruelty to foreigners, their
inherent instinct of exploitation, their theoretical stupidity are
mingled with practical shrewdness and utter brazenness.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>On page 39 he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Meanwhile the Britons have not distinguished themselves in
anything, if we are not to take into consideration the fact that
being thoroughly incapable of creating their own language, they
have by their talent to distort languages given to the present
English people a repulsive Judeo-Carthaginian imprint through
their shameless self-satisfaction, arrogance and treacherous inclinations.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>On page 41 he said:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;In 1843 the first lodge of the new Jewish union &#8216;Bnai Brith&#8217;
was organized in New York. Gradually this Jewish &#8216;Bnai
Brith&#8217; concentrates in its hands the direction of all Masonic
lodges in America, and through them it directs American politics.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>&#8220;When we become rulers, we shall regard as undesirable the
existence of any religion except our own, proclaiming one God
with Whom our fate is tied as the Chosen People, and by Whom
our fate has been made one with the fate of the world. For
this reason we must destroy all other religions. If thereby
should emerge contemporary atheists, then, as a transition step,
this will not interfere with our aims. It will serve as an example
to coming generations who will listen to the teachings of
the Mosaic religion. By its sound and reasonable system, we
have achieved the subjugation of all nations. We shall emphasize
its mystic law in which we will say lies all power.</p>

<p>&#8220;On every occasion we will publish articles in which we will
compare our beneficent rule with the past. The benefits of
peace, though achieved through centuries of turmoil, will stand
out in relief in this era of blessings. The shortcomings of the
Gentile administrations will be pictured by us in the darkest
colors. We will sow such antipathy toward their governments
that the masses will prefer peace in a condition of servitude to
the rights of the so-called liberty which so tormented them and
destroyed the very springs of human existence and which were
exploited by a host of adventures, not realizing what they were
doing. The masses will become so satiated with the endless
changes of administration, which we instigated among the Gentiles
when we were undermining their governmental institutions,
that they will tolerate anything from us rather than risk undergoing
again such struggle and hardships. We will especially
emphasize the historical mistakes of the <a name="typo9" id="typo9"></a>Gentile administrations
which caused mankind to suffer for many centuries through lack
of real understanding in all that concerned its true welfare, pursuing
fantastic projects of social welfare and not noticing that
these projects made worse instead of better the state of general
relationships which are the basis of human existences.</p>

<p>&#8220;The chief strength of our principles and measures will lie
in that they are put forward and interpreted by us as a sharp
contrast to the old and decayed order of society.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our philosophers will discuss all the shortcomings of the
Gentile religions, but no one will be allowed to discuss our religion
from the true point of view except our own people. We
shall have a fundamental knowledge of it and will never dare
to disclose its secrets.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;When we become rulers, we shall at each suitable occasion
compare our beneficent rule with the former unsystematic administrations....
The mistakes of the administrations of the
Gentiles will be pictured by us in the most lurid colors: we will
sow such antipathy and hatred toward these governments that
the masses will prefer peace and quiet in a condition of servitude
to the rights of the so-called liberty which for many ages had
so tormented them and destroyed the very springs of human
existence and which were exploited by adventurers, who did not
realize what they were doing.</p>

<p>&#8220;The masses will become so satiated with the useless changes
of administration, which we instigated when we were undermining
their institutions, that they will accept anything that we
may give them rather than risk undergoing again such struggle
and disorder.... Moreover, we will, through public criticism,
especially emphasize the mistakes of the Gentile administrations
which caused mankind to suffer for many centuries through lack
of real understanding in all that concerned its true welfare, pursuing
fantastic projects of social welfare and not noticing that
these projects made worse instead of better the state of general
relationships which are the basis of human existence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our principles and faith will be especially useful inasmuch as
they will be put forward and interpreted by us as a contrast to
the old and decayed order of society.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our philosophers will discuss and criticise the shortcomings
of the Gentile religions, but the latter will not be able to answer
with regard to our faith, for no one is acquainted with
<a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a><span class="pagenum" title="81"></span>its mysteries except our Rabbis and <a name="typo8" id="typo8"></a>Talmudists, and they will
never reveal it, for on them depends the power of guiding our
flock.</p></div>

<p>Для достиженія этого, по всей Европѣ, а съ помощью ея отношеній
и на другихъ континентахъ, мы должны создать броженія,
пререканія, раздоры и вражду. Въ этомъ—двоякая польза: во
первыхъ, мы держимъ въ страхѣ всѣ страны, хорошо вѣдающія,
что мы властны произвести по желанію безпорядки или водворить
порядокъ въ нихъ. Онѣ привыкли видѣть въ насъ необходимое
давленіе: <em>мы запутали всѣ нити, протянутыя въ Государственные
Кабинеты всемірною политикой, экономическими договорами
или долговыми обязательствами</em>. Для достиженія этого
послѣдняго обстоятельства намъ надо было вооружиться большою
хитростью и даже пронырливостью во время переговоровъ и соглашеній:
но въ томъ, что называется оффиціальнымъ языкомъ,
мы должны были казаться сговорчивыми и правдивыми. Такимъ

<p><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a><span class="pagenum" title="83"></span>Thus it is seen that Butmi, publishing his version of
the &#8220;protocols&#8221; in 1907, two years after the Nilus
version had appeared, changed the text to suit his purposes.
In 1905, before the first Russian revolution, the
Nilus version of the &#8220;protocols&#8221; said &#8220;<em>we will show one
of them our strength by means of violence, that is, by
terrorism</em>.&#8221; After the revolution, Butmi changed this
sentence to read &#8220;<em>We have shown one of these governments
our powers by assassination, by terrorism</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now the introducers of the &#8220;protocols&#8221; in this
country and in Europe are pointing to bolshevism as the
fulfillment of the &#8220;documents&#8221; which have been concocted,
elaborated and changed by antisemites to serve the devious
political purposes of their masters and their own.</p>

<p>The &#8220;protocols&#8221; came into the world with the trademark,
&#8220;made in Germany&#8221; and were elaborated under the
auspices of the &#8220;Russian Black Hundreds&#8221; in their efforts
to save the dying Russian autocracy. When the Russian
autocracy was overthrown and members of the &#8220;Black
Hundreds&#8221; were scattered in various lands, their financial
and &#8220;moral&#8221; support shattered, they set out in quest of
new sources of income. They are now resorting to their
old discredited methods in a new environment and thus
the poison of the Russian Black Hundreds is being
spread in England, Germany, France, the Scandinavian
countries, Japan, and even in this country. The voice
is the voice of dead despotic Russia, and the hand is the
hand of the same &#8220;Black Hundreds.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now cowardly anonymous writers are embellishing
the &#8220;protocols,&#8221; adding new lies to the old ones, making
accusations against the Jews that even Nilus-Lutostansky-Butmi
dared not make in darkest Russia. Perhaps
some day these new legends and absurd, malicious myths
may evolve into a new and revised edition of secret Jewish
&#8220;protocols.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a><span class="pagenum" title="84"></span>In periods of turmoil and unrest such venomous fabrications
may gain credence among the ignorant and may
poison their minds. But, like all anti-semitic myths of
old, the new anti-Jewish legends are bound to destroy
themselves. A lie shuns the sunlight. It thrives in darkness.
It cannot survive analysis. The truth will prevail.</p>

<p>Israel has no secret protocols, no hidden designs. After
all its tribulations, its dream is still of peace, of justice
and of human brotherhood. After all the centuries the
word that came from Sinai and the message of the
prophets of old are still enshrined in its heart. Indeed
as has been aptly said: &#8220;The Holy Scriptures are the
only authentic protocols of the Wise Men of Zion.&#8221;</p>

<hr style='width: 80%;' />

<p><strong>RESURRECTION. By Count Leo Tolstoi.</strong> (Published
1900.) It depicts with a master hand the ocean of life rocked
by storm and lulled to sleep and ease. In the splash of every
wave is heard the story of human emotions, misery, disenchantment,
suffering, crime, and life, that is true&#8212;even in
art. Illustrated. Cloth bound. Price, $1.00; postpaid.<br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>&#8220;FOMA GORDEYEV.&#8221; By Maxim Gorky.</strong> (Published 1901.)
This book made Gorky&#8217;s literary reputation in Russia, Germany
and France. It is a most remarkable novel. The New
York <em>Evening Post</em> says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;Maxim Gorky, the young Russian poet of the vagabond and the
proletariat, the most ardent worshipper at the shrine of Nietzsche and
his ideal &#8216;Over-Man,&#8217; owes much of his sudden popularity to his personality.
The son of a poor upholsterer, Gorky was thrown upon his
own resources at the age of nine and since then has experienced a
wide range of human emotions, struggles, depravity and misery.
Shoemaker, apple peddler, painter, dock-hand, railroad workman,
baker and tramp, this unique author had a thousand and one similar
occupations, and had even made more than one attempt to take his
own life.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>This version of <strong>Foma Gordeyev</strong>, is in no way abridged, giving
the exact reproduction of the thought and expression of
the author. Cloth bound. Price, $1.00; postpaid.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>THE SEVEN WHO WERE HANGED. By Leonid Andreyev.</strong>
(Published 1909.) What reviewers say:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&#8220;It is by reason of its art even more real, more horrifying, more
impressive than any other Russian fiction translated in a long time.
Under the crystal simplicity of Andreyev&#8217;s style each spirit reveals
itself, stripped of its bodily covering, in its inmost truth.&#8221;&#8212;<strong>New York
Times.</strong></p>

<p>&#8220;Grewsome because it is fearfully real. But it is compelling for
the same reason.&#8221;&#8212;<strong>New York World.</strong></p>

<p>&#8220;It is not a mere morbid probing into the abnormal and horrible.
It has its mission. It is a grim and terrible picture, and it is painted
with tremendous art&#8212;the art of a Dore.&#8221;&#8212;<strong>Chicago Inter-Ocean.</strong></p></div>

<p>Cloth bound. Price, $1.00; postpaid.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>THE FORGED COUPON. By Count Leo Tolstoi.</strong> (Published
1912.) This story shows the successive evil and wrong
resulting from the forging of a bank note by a student in
need of money. Numerous crimes succeed each other as a
result of this first wrong act, until the wave of crime is
checked by a poor, ignorant woman and a lame tailor, who
follow the real teaching of Christ. The book contains also
<strong>After the Ball</strong>, a story of love and military life; <strong>Korney Vasilyev</strong>,
a story of peasant life; <strong>Tolstoi&#8217;s Vital Humanitarian
Ideas</strong>, giving the very essence of the fountain-spring and incentive
of all the literary work ever written by this wonderful
man&#8212;a peep, as it were, at the power-works of his thinking
machine. Cloth bound. Price, $1.00; postpaid.</p>

(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
